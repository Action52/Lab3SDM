Poorly defined scope of work has been ranked as the one of the highest reasons for poor performance over which owners and construction stakeholders have control. An owner's requirements and expectations are specified during the programming phase of a project and these define a design's scope of work. One focus of Target Value Design (TVD) is making owner's value a primary driver of design by improving project definition during programming-thus optimizing the design phase. While the number of published research articles praising TVD has been increasing, there is a dearth of information regarding the application of architectural programming (AP) to Target Value Design exercises, which engage stakeholders in a design decision making process called Choosing by Advantages (CBA). CBA first requires identification of attributes that are of value to an owner. The purpose of this research was to explore the importance of architectural programming in helping to identify key attributes of value to an owner, and to report on a lean game designed and preliminarily validated by the authors to investigate the accuracy and perception of attribute identification through AP as represented by the game. © 27th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction, IGLC 2019.

The tracking method uses a monocular camera and makes no assumptions on the shape of the terrain or the target motion. The UAV runs two cascaded estimators. The first is an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which is responsible for tracking the UAV's state, such as position and velocity relative to a fixed frame. The second estimator is an EKF that is responsible for estimating a fixed number of landmarks within the camera's field of view. Landmarks are parameterized by a quaternion associated with bearing from the camera's optical axis and an inverse distance parameter. The bearing quaternion allows for a minimal representation of each landmark's direction and distance, a filter with no singularities, and a fast update rate due to few trigonometric functions. Three methods for estimating the ground target positions are demonstrated: the first uses the landmark estimator directly on the targets, the second computes the target depth with a weighted average of converged landmark depths, and the third extends the target's measured bearing vector to intersect a ground plane approximated from the landmark estimates. Simulation results show that the third target estimation method yields the most accurate results. © 2017, Institute of Navigation.",,Aircraft detection; Antennas; Cameras; Global positioning system; Inverse problems; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Distance parameter; Minimal representation; Monocular cameras; Multiple grounds; Reference frame; Target estimations; Trigonometric functions; Weighted averages; Extended Kalman filters,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047864637,Poster,ExpertGroup,Jorge Sullivan,"['Charles Wolfe', 'Whitney Stark', 'Kenneth Kent', 'Kimberly Maynard']","['Rejected', 'Accepted', 'Rejected', 'Rejected']","['Stock ball organization recognize civil development.

The tensile pull-out strength of the composite rebar embedded in concrete was measured and compared to steel rebar. Fiberglass/epoxy is less likely to corrode than steel rebar, ensuring more sustainable concrete structures in infrastructure applications. The 0.5"" diameter composite rebar was produced by pulling hundreds of strands of unidirectional fiberglass/epoxy towpreg to form the core of a cylindrical rod. The rods were consolidated by overwrapping strands of aramid fiber under tension in a spiral fashion, and cured using the manufacturer's (TCR Composites) recommended 250¡F cure cycle. Configurations manufactured and tested included tow variations of aramid overwrap (dry and prepreg) with and without sand coating embedded in concrete cubes (8""x8""x8""). The results are compared to baseline values obtained by testing traditional steel rebar and commercially-Available fiberglass composite rebar. The tensile pull-out (bond) strength was quantified using a test fixture in accordance with ACI 440.3R-12. Measurements were collected at both the free and loaded ends of the rebar, with freeend results yielding a more accurate indication of rebar bond stress. The bond strength of the in-house manufactured fiberglass/epoxy rebar was comparable to steel rebar and commercial fiberglass composite rebar. The sand coating increased the surface roughness, improving the bond strength of the composite rebar by margins of 43-58% percent. Fiberglass/epoxy composite rebar consolidated with prepreg aramid tow and subsequently coated with sand resulted in a bond strength slightly higher, but comparable to steel. This study demonstrates the ability to consistently produce high quality fiberglass/epoxy composite rebar using an innovative, low cost, high production rate, three-dimensional braiding process. © 2018 33rd Technical Conference of the American Society for Composites 2018.

Based on simulations performed in communication Network Simulator 2, empirical cumulative distribution functions can be associated with transfer times of measurement packets, which will reflect communication parameters and irregularities. This is further used to form an algorithm which maximizes the number of successful network observability checks, and thus the number of possible state estimations, in a certain time period.

One of these new methods involves researchers creating random peptides and testing their antimicrobial activity. Developing antibiotics from these peptides requires understanding which sequence motifs will be toxic to bacteria. To determine if the toxic peptides of a randomly-generated peptide library can be uniquely classified based solely on sequence motifs, we created the PepSeq Pipeline: a new software that utilizes a Random Forest algorithm to extract motifs from a peptide library. We found that this pipeline can accurately classify 56% of the toxic peptides in the peptide library using motifs extracted from the model. Testing on simulated data with less noise, we could classify up to 94% of the toxic peptides. The pipeline extracted significant toxic motifs in every library that was tested, but its ability to classify all toxic peptides depended on the number of motifs in the library. Once extracted, these motifs can be used both to understand the biology behind why certain peptides are toxic and to create novel antibiotics.

This paper presents a novel approach that involves treating the team as a moldable volume, in which deformations of the volume correspond to changes in team shape. The team possesses a level of autonomy that allows the team to travel to and surround buildings of interest in a patrol and cordon scenario. During surround mode, the operator explores or manipulates the team shape to create desired formations around a building. A spacing interaction method also allows the operator to adjust how robots are spaced within the current shape. Separate haptic feedback is developed for each method to allow the operator to ""feel"" the shape or spacing manipulation. During travel mode, the operator chooses desired travel locations and receives feedback to help identify how and where the team travels. Results from a user study suggest that haptic feedback significantly improves operator performance in a reconnaissance task when task demand is higher, but may slightly increase operator workload. In the context of the experimental setup, these results suggest that haptic feedback may contribute to heads-up control of a team of autonomous robots.

We present and evaluate a set of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), that are designed to allow a human to express intent by expressing desirable tradeoffs. The GUIs require an algorithm that identifies the set of Pareto optimal solutions to the multi-objective decision problem, which means that all the solutions are equally good in the sense that there are no other solutions better for every objective. Given the Pareto set, the GUIs provide different ways for a human to express intent by exploring tradeoffs between objectives; once a tradeoff is selected, the solution is chosen. The GUI designs are applied to interactive human-robot path-selection for a robot in an urban environment, but they can be applied to other tradeoff problems. A user study evaluates GUI designs by requiring users to select a tradeoff that satisfies a specified mission intent. Results of the user study suggest that GUIs designed to support an artist's palette-metaphor can be used to express intent without incurring unacceptable levels of human workload. © 2017 ACM.",human-robot interaction; multi-objective decision making; robot path-planning; user interface design,Graphical user interfaces; Machine design; Man machine systems; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Pareto principle; Robot programming; Robots; User interfaces; Design and evaluations; Graphical user interface (GUIs); Multi objective decision making; Multi-objective optimization problem; Multiobjective decision; Pareto optimal solutions; Robot path-planning; User interface designs; Human robot interaction,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021808843,Full Paper,RegularConference,Dana Nguyen,"['Charles Wolfe', 'Collin Lopez', 'Whitney Stark', 'Kenneth Kent']","['Rejected', 'Rejected', 'Accepted', 'Accepted']","['Great record affect same number drug continue serve.

Over recent years, this has led to the implicit assumption that the quality of such embeddings is determined solely by their ability to facilitate transfer learning. In this position paper we argue that pre-trained linguistic embeddings have value above and beyond their utility as input features for downstream tasks. We adopt a paradigm in which they are instead treated as implicit knowledge repositories that can be used to solve common-sense reasoning problems via linear operations on embedded text. To validate this paradigm, we apply our methodology to tasks such as threat detection, emotional classification, and sentiment analysis, and demonstrate that linguistic embeddings show strong potential at solving such tasks directly, without the need for additional training. Motivated by these results, we advocate for empirical evaluations of language models that include vector-based reasoning tasks in addition to more traditional benchmarks, with the ultimate goal of facilitating language-based reasoning, or Ôreasoning in the linguistic domainÕ. We conclude by analyzing the structure of currently available embedding models and identifying several shortcomings which must be overcome in order to realize the full potential of this approach. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Common-sense reasoning; Language model evaluation; Language models; Sentence embeddings; Word embeddings,Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Intelligent computing; Sentiment analysis; Transfer learning; Based reasonings; Commonsense reasoning; Emotional classification; Empirical evaluations; Implicit knowledge; Internal representation; Linear operations; Threat detection; Embeddings,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088499748,Demo Paper,ExpertGroup,Cheryl Bradley,"['Mary Alvarez', 'Whitney Stark']","['Accepted', 'Accepted']","['Later street mention would technology budget first.

It can be difficult to predict the transfer of distortion through a compressor because traditional experimental and computational methods are very expensive and time consuming. The Harmonic Balance approach is a promising alternative which uses Fourier techniques to represent fluid flow solutions. Relatively little work has been done to assess how much Fourier information is necessary to calculate a sufficiently accurate solution with the Harmonic Balance Solver. This study focuses on analyzing the effects of varying the amount of modal content that is used in Harmonic Balance simulations. Inlet distortion profiles with varying magnitudes are used in order to analyze trends and provide insight into the distortion flow physics for various inlet conditions. The geometry is a single stage axial compressor that consists of an inlet guide vane followed by the NASA Stage 37 rotor. It is shown that simulations with greater magnitudes of distortion require more modal content in order to achieve sufficiently accurate results. Harmonic Balance simulations are shown to have significantly lower computational costs than simulations with a conventional unsteady solver. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

It then uses these limitations to make a recommendation for well clear in ADS-B-equipped airspace that has a high density of small UAS operations. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

For small UAS, the need is especially critical because of the clutter and the air-traffic density at low altitudes where they operate. For the community of researchers who are developing SAA technology for small UAS, there is a critical need for a rich, openly-accessible compendium of encounter data with which to develop, test, and evaluate SAA algorithms. In this paper we introduce a publicly available database of small UAS encounter data, the small aircraft flight encounter (SAFE) database, with an initial deposit of 11 flight encounters. In these encounters two target aircraft, a fixed-wing and a multi-rotor are imaged by a separate fixed-wing aircraft carrying two high-definition video cameras and a unique radar unit. The data contain ground-truth navigation estimates for both the target and imaging aircraft. The target aircraft are observed in the video footage but not in the radar imagery; continuing efforts include tuning and refinement of the radar parameters and expansion of the SAFE database to support small UAS SAA technology development. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.
