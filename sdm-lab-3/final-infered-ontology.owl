        <gf:abstract>Inlet flow distortion significantly affects an engineÕs overall performance. It can be difficult to predict the transfer of distortion through a compressor because traditional experimental and computational methods are very expensive and time consuming. The Harmonic Balance approach is a promising alternative which uses Fourier techniques to represent fluid flow solutions. Relatively little work has been done to assess how much Fourier information is necessary to calculate a sufficiently accurate solution with the Harmonic Balance Solver. This study focuses on analyzing the effects of varying the amount of modal content that is used in Harmonic Balance simulations. Inlet distortion profiles with varying magnitudes are used in order to analyze trends and provide insight into the distortion flow physics for various inlet conditions. The geometry is a single stage axial compressor that consists of an inlet guide vane followed by the NASA Stage 37 rotor. It is shown that simulations with greater magnitudes of distortion require more modal content in order to achieve sufficiently accurate results. Harmonic Balance simulations are shown to have significantly lower computational costs than simulations with a conventional unsteady solver. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

    <gf:abstract>This paper investigates the application of 16-APSK modulation to aeronautical mobile telemetry. The peak-to-average power ratio vs. code rate tradeoffis mapped to an optimization problem involving spectral efficiency and the constellation parameters. The optimization results produce a theoretically optimum solution that is 3.95 times more spectrally efficient as uncoded SOQPSKTG. When implementation losses and the available IRIG 106 LDPC code rates are factored in, the advantage drops to 3.20 times the spectral efficiency of SOQPSK-TG.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Systems of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), such as the Amazon Air delivery system, will play a large part in future aerospace development. The design and implementation of these systems will be economically, transportationally, and environmentally important. In this paper, we use agent-based models to analyze the emergent behavior of several types of UAV systems with varying parameters and environments. We find that while increasing the number of UAVs initially has a more-than-linear effect on the reported separation incidents, this effect quickly levels off due to carrying capacity limitations. We also find that while different behaviors (objectives and movement patterns) of UAVs affects the locations of the separation incidents, the number of separation incidents is not strongly influenced by these changes. We then explore the implementation of separation-assurance mechanisms using varying levels of information, and examine effects on the emergent behavior. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Triple modular redundancy (TMR) is commonly employed to increase the reliability and mean time to failure (MTTF) of a system. This improvement can be shown by using a continuous time Markov chain. However, typical Markov chain models do not model common cause failures (CCF), which is a singular event that simultaneously causes failure in multiple redundant modules. This paper introduces a new Markov chain to model CCF in TMR with repair systems. This new model is compared to the idealized models of TMR with repair without CCF. The fundamental limitations that CCF imposes on the system are shown and discussed. In a motivating example, it is seen that CCF imposes a limitation of 51_ on the reliability improvement in a system with TMR and repair compared to a simplex system, (i.e., without TMR). A case study is also presented where the likelihood of CCF is reduced by a factor of 18_ using various mitigation techniques. Reducing the CCF compounds the reliability improvement of TMR with repair and leads to a overall system reliability improvement of 10,000_ compared to the simplex system as supported by the proposed model. © 2020 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Developing secure software is inherently difficult, and is further hampered by a rush to market, the lack of cybersecurity-trained architects and developers, and the difficulty of identifying flaws and deploying mitigations. To address these problems, we advocate for an alternative paradigm-layering security onto applications from global control points, such as the browser, operating system, or network. This approach adds security to existing applications, relieving developers of this burden. The benefits of this paradigm are three-fold-(1) increased correctness in the implementation of security features, (2) coverage for all software, even non-maintained legacy software, and (3) more rapid and consistent deployment of threat mitigations and new security features. To demonstrate these benefits, we describe three concrete instantiations of this paradigm- MessageGuard, a system that layers end-to-end encryption in the browser; TrustBase, a system that layers authentication in the operating system; and software-defined perimeter, which layers access control at network middleboxes. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Crowdfundmg has emerged as a prominent way for entrepreneurs to secure funding without sophisticated intermediation. In crowd- funding, an entrepreneur often has to decide how to disclose the campaign status in order to collect as many contributions as poss ible. Such decisions are difficult to make primarily due to incomp lete information. We propose information design as a tool to help the entrepreneur to improve revenue by influencing backers' bel iefs. We introduce a heuristic algorithm to dynamically compute information-disclosure policies for the entrepreneur, followed by an empirical evaluation to demonstrate its competitiveness over the widely-adopted immediate-disclosure policy. Our results demons trate that the immediate-disclosure policy is not optimal when backers follow thresholding policies despite its ease of implementat ion. With appropriate heuristics, an entrepreneur can benefit from dynamic information disclosure. Our work sheds light on inform ation design in a dynamic setting where agents make decisions using thresholding policies. © 2018 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This paper addresses the relevance of integrating intellectual property (IP) rights studies within contemporary industrial design studio courses. As recently as 2014, an article on design and IP argues that Òrecent legal and cultural evolutions within the United States Intellectual Property systemÓÉ Òdo not favour student inventors and hinder their ability to protect their creative workÓ and students would be better served using their resources on more fruitful pursuits. However, IP culture surrounding Design Patents/Design Rights has substantially changed in the last decade and it is time for this position to be readdressed. This paper reviews the reframing of Brigham Young UniversityÕs third-year industrial design studio course to include training on IP. It appraises the current state of IP training in design schools and how design related IP has markedly shifted in recent years. It outlines basic IP exercises and introduces case studies for the four the primary types of IP: Copyrights, Trademarks, Design and Utility Patents. Students are exposed to two opposing mindsets regarding IP: the traditional position that views IP as a defensive tool to build a fence around an individualÕs rights; and more importantly, how to use IP as a collaborative bridge between other market players enabling meaningful market offerings.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The current state of certificate-based authentication is messy, with broken authentication in applications and proxies, along with serious flaws in the CA system. To solve these problems, we design TrustBase, an architecture that provides certificate-based authentication as an operating system service, with system administrator control over authentication policy. TrustBase transparently enforces best practices for certificate validation on all applications, while also providing a variety of authentication services to strengthen the CA system. We describe a research prototype of TrustBase for Linux, which uses a loadable kernel module to intercept traffic in the socket layer, then consults a userspace policy engine to evaluate certificate validity using a variety of plugins. We evaluate the security of TrustBase, including a threat analysis, application coverage, and hardening of the Linux prototype. We also describe prototypes of TrustBase for Android and Windows, illustrating the generality of our approach. We show that TrustBase has negligible overhead and universal compatibility with applications. We demonstrate its utility by describing eight authentication services that extend CA hardening to all applications. © 2017 by The USENIX Association. All Rights Reserved.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This paper proposes a method to provide secrecy for digital communications with arbitrarily large quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations for transmission over a Gaussian fading wiretap channel. This is accomplished by breaking the constellation down into nested quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) symbols and randomizing the assignment between message bits and modulated symbols using channel state information (CSI). If enough random bits can be generated from CSI it becomes possible to uniquely map an arbitrary message to any symbol in the large QAM constellation. The proposed method can thereby provide perfect secrecy while maintaining high reliability by exclusively assigning minimum-distance-mapped constellations through the randomization for use by the legitimate decoder. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The ability to control radiative behavior through the angular positioning of structured surfaces (e.g. the cavity effect) offers the ability to provide thermal management in dynamic radiative environments. Structures comprised of origami tessellations offer a means to achieve angular cavities that approach black-like behavior during collapse by exploiting use of the cavity effect. Expanded origami surfaces exhibit intrinsic radiative properties while collapsed surfaces exhibit increasingly black-like behavior as the cavity aspect ratio increases. Actuation of such surfaces provides the means to achieve any apparent radiative behavior between these two extremes. This work explores the use of three origami structures (finite V-groove, hinged V-groove and Miura-ori) and their respective apparent radiative properties as a function of cavity geometry using Monte Carlo ray tracing. Results are presented as a function of tessellation geometry and degree of actuation (i.e. collapse). Ray tracing models are benchmarked with V-groove geometries for which analytical models exist in the literature. Convergence for ray independence was determined to be satisfactory when the standard error of the mean for every test case was less than 0.005. Deviation in the apparent absorptivity for finite V-groove relative to the infinite V-groove is quantified. The apparent absorptivity of the Miura-ori fold exhibits sensitivity to the fold geometry when the angle of the unit cell is varied, but is relatively insensitive to the length ratio of the panel. The variable nature of the net radiative heat transfer, achievable through actuation, affords a method for thermal management of components with variable heat dissipation and/or variable radiative environments. © 2018 International Heat Transfer Conference.

    <gf:abstract>Methods exist for the creation of antireflective thin film layers; however, many of these methods depend on the use of high temperatures, harsh chemical etches, or are made with difficult pattern materials, rendering them unusable for many applications. In addition, most methods of light blocking are specifically designed to increase light coupling and absorption in the substrate, making them incompatible with some applications that also require blocking transmission of light. A method of forming a simple, patternable light-blocking layer that drastically reduces both transmission and reflection of light without dependence on processes that could damage underlying structures using a light scattering matte coating over a partially antireflective thin film light-blocking layer is presented. © 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>An interest in border defense, surveillance, and interdiction has recently increased for a variety of reasons related to issues of illegal immigration, terrorism, drug and human trafficking, and other potential threats. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer an attractive alternative to supporting and defending various threats at borders. This paper applies a differential game to define a border defense scenario where one UAV (pursuer) seeks to capture two intruders (evaders) before they reach a designated border. The evaders can be UAVs, marine or ground vehicles, or human agents, but they have a lower maximum speed than the pursuer throughout the game. Simple motion is assumed for the pursuer and evaders with complete state information shared across all agents. The game is played within a rectangular area with a parallel top and bottom border of length L and left and right borders with a length of W, for a game aspect ratio of L_W. The value of the game is the minimum distance to the bottom border achieved by the evaders at any time before capture of both evaders. Within the region where the pursuer wins, the game of degree is explored and the optimal policy for both the evaders and pursuer is derived using geometric properties. © 2020 by John Salmon.

        <gf:abstract>Reliable track continuity is an important characteristic of multiple target tracking (MTT) algorithms. In the specific case of tracking multiple ground targets from an aerial platform, challenges arise due to realistic operating environments such as imperfections in the measurement source. Some popular visual detection techniques include Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT)-based motion detection, difference imaging, and object feature matching. Each of these algorithmic detectors has fundamental limitations in regard to providing consistent measurements. In this paper we present a scalable detection framework that leverages multiple measurement sources. We also present the recursive random sample consensus (R-RANSAC) algorithm in a data fusion architecture that can simultaneously accommodate multiple measurement sources. We demonstrate robust track continuity using post-processed flight data and show real-time computational performance. © 2018 AACC.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Metabolic labeling of proteins with non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) provides unique bioorthogonal chemical groups during de novo synthesis by taking advantage of both endogenous and heterologous protein synthesis machineries. Labeled proteins can then be selectively conjugated to fluorophores, affinity reagents, peptides, polymers, nanoparticles or surfaces for a wide variety of downstream applications in proteomics and biotechnology. In this review, we focus on techniques in which proteins are residue- and site-specifically labeled with ncAAs containing bioorthogonal handles. These ncAA-labeled proteins are: readily enriched from cells and tissues for identification via mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis; selectively purified for downstream biotechnology applications; or labeled with fluorophores for in situ analysis. To facilitate the wider use of these techniques, we provide decision trees to help guide the design of future experiments. It is expected that the use of ncAA labeling will continue to expand into new application areas where spatial and temporal analysis of proteome dynamics and engineering new chemistries and new function into proteins are desired. © 2019 The Author(s).</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Despite mounting demand for a more sustainable worldwide water supply system, available reservoir capacity is relentlessly diminishing due to sedimentation. Neither sustainable reservoir life spans nor intergenerational equity is achieved through conventional cost-benefit analyses (CBAs), which render all benefits and costs projected to occur more than several decades into a project as negligible. Consequently, future costs, including dam decommissioning or retrofitting with sediment management facilities, would be regarded as nonfactors in an analysis. CBAs have also historically failed to account for infrastructure and environmental impacts of sedimentation over time. Alternatives to the traditional application of the CBA do exist, however, such as dam owners instituting retirement funds or insurance policies, beneficiaries paying for rehabilitation or maintenance, and economists incorporating infrastructure damages and potentially logistic discount rates into their analyses. A brief case study of Gavins Point Dam shows that available information on damages due to a lack of sediment management account for 70% of the actual construction cost and would likely exceed construction costs if all damage information were available. By integrating these alternatives, economic analyses for reservoirs will be more accurate, reservoir life spans will be more sustainable, profits will be extended indefinitely, and the economic burdens placed on future generations will be lessened. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>The effects of combinations of dissimilar aluminum alloys during Friction stir welding (FSW) on the process response and resultant joint properties are experimentally investigated using two dissimilar automotive structural aluminum alloys. Depending on the materials on the advancing and retreating sides of the tool travel direction during FSW, four different material combinations are considered. FSW joints without macroscopic defects are successfully fabricated for the four different material combinations. The optical microscopy results show that the macroscopic material mixing behaviors of the two dissimilar material combinations during FSW are somewhat different from each other, even though the process responses during joining are not much different. The results of the quasi-static tensile tests and EBSD analysis demonstrate that the mechanical behaviors and orientation changes of the joint during tensile deformation are affected by the material locations with respect to the tool travel direction during FSW. © 2017, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>More than 1 billion people suffer from chronic respiratory diseases worldwide, accounting for more than 4 million deaths annually. Inhaled corticosteroid is a popular medication for treating chronic respiratory diseases. Its side effects include decreased bone mineral density and osteoporosis. The aims of this study are to investigate the association of inhaled corticosteroids and fracture and to design a clinical support system for fracture prediction. The data of patients aged 20 years and older, who had visited healthcare centers and been prescribed with inhaled corticosteroids within 2002-2010, were retrieved from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). After excluding patients diagnosed with hip fracture or vertebrate fractures before using inhaled corticosteroid, a total of 11645 patients receiving inhaled corticosteroid therapy were included for this study. Among them, 1134 (9.7%) were diagnosed with hip fracture or vertebrate fracture. The statistical results showed that demographic information, chronic respiratory diseases and comorbidities, and corticosteroid-related variables (cumulative dose, mean exposed daily dose, follow-up duration, and exposed duration) were significantly different between fracture and nonfracture patients. The clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) were designed with integrated genetic algorithm (GA) and support vector machine (SVM) by training and validating the models with balanced training sets obtained by random and cluster-based undersampling methods and testing with the imbalanced NHIRD dataset. Two different objective functions were adopted for obtaining optimal models with best predictive performance. The predictive performance of the CDSSs exhibits a sensitivity of 69.84-77.00% and an AUC of 0.7495-0.7590. It was concluded that long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids may induce osteoporosis and exhibit higher incidence of hip or vertebrate fractures. The accumulated dose of ICS and OCS therapies should be continuously monitored, especially for patients with older age and women after menopause, to prevent from exceeding the maximum dosage. © 2018 Yung-Fu Chen et al.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This paper summarizes the development of the Utah intersection crash prediction model (UICPM) and the intersection safety analysis methodology (ISAM). The UICPM is a Bayesian generalized linear model that creates distributions of the expected number of crashes at each intersection, compares the actual number of crashes to the distribution, and ranks the intersections based on safety concern. The ISAM is the process that was developed to execute the UICPM. The first step is to prepare the model input by combining the roadway and crash data files. Crashes are assigned to intersections if they are located with the functional area of an intersection. The second step is to execute the UICPM using the R graphical user interface (GUI) tool and R software. The third step is to create a two-page intersection safety analysis report (ISAR) for intersections of interest and maps of the state, regions, and counties to visualize the model results. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Extended interactions between agents have commonly been studied in the context of repeated games (RGs), in which the same players repeatedly interact in the same scenario. However, such interactions are uncommon in practice. Typically, the players' goals, action sets, and payoffs change from encounter to encounter, often in ways the players cannot easily model or control. These more realistic interactions, which we model as a form of stochastic game called interaction games (IGs), have attributes which prohibit the straightforward application of many often-used algorithms developed for RGs. In this paper, we generalize several algorithms previously designed for RGs, and explore their behavior and performance in IGs. Our results suggest that at least some of the methodologies designed for RGs can, with some modifications, be extended to IGs. © 2019 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

    <gf:abstract>There are a limited number of methods to guide and confirm the placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) at the cavoatrial junction. The aim of this study was to design, test and validate a dual-wavelength, diode laser-based, single optical fiber instrument that would accurately confirm PICC tip location at the cavoatrial junction of an animal heart, in vivo. This was accomplished by inserting the optical fiber into a PICC and ratiometrically comparing simultaneous visible and near-infrared reflection intensities of venous and atrial tissues found near the cavoatrial junction. The system was successful in placing the PICC line tip within 5 mm of the cavoatrial junction. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>One of the challenges of integrating pressure gain combustion into a gas turbine engine is that a turbine driven by pulsing flow experiences a decrease in efficiency. Computational fluid dynamic simulations validated with experiments showed that pulse amplitude is the driving factor for decreased turbine efficiency and not the pulsing frequency. A quadratic correlation between turbine efficiency and corrected pulse amplitude is presented. Incidence variation is shown to cause the change in turbine efficiency and a correlation between corrected incidence and corrected amplitude is shown to predict turbine efficiency.

    <gf:abstract>This study discusses the need, development, and validation of the Innovation Test Instrument (ITI). This article outlines how the researchers identified the content domain of the assessment and created test items. Then, it describes initial validation testing of the instrument. The findings suggest that the ITI is a good first step in creating an innovation assessment because it is more inclusive of both divergent and convergent thinking. In comparison, past innovation assessments have only assessed either divergence or convergence. The ITI still needs further validation and improvement to make strong claims about its ability to determine the effectiveness of an innovation course. © 2017, Virginia Polytechnic Institute.

        <gf:abstract>One critical antecedent to project success is team alignment. Industry professionals should focus on practices that can improve project team selection, team building, and identifying challenges to the team and project, hence improving alignment. This paper provides a summary of key findings of a national study of transportation projects, identifying current practices of industry professionals for the selection and alignment of project teams for transportation projects. Current team selection practices, the most beneficial team alignment practices, and the greatest challenges to team alignment are identified in the study. These practices are also analyzed and reported by project delivery method, and the results presented in this paper add to the body of knowledge by identifying current alignment practices, successful practices, and challenges specific to each delivery method. Among the findings are that overall project teams are selected primarily based on project experience and ability to meet schedule, regardless of the project delivery method chosen. Successful teams with good alignment were found to be characterized by having established expectations, team trust, honesty within the team, shared values, and good communication. No notable differences were found among delivery methods, demonstrating that the principles of team alignment are not dependent on the project delivery method. Challenges that cause adversarial relationships in the team include issues of constructability, schedule availability, and project complexity. The study also identified transportation-specific alignment challenges such as public involvement. The greatest challenges specific to each delivery method include team coordination for construction manager at risk (CMAR) projects, constructability procedures for design-bid-build projects, and environmental impacts for design-build projects. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Sanders and Stappers (2013) propose a new interpretation of design disciplines that is not delineated by traditional fields such as industrial design, graphic design, or architecture, but by themes focusing on Òpeople in the context of their livesÓ such as design for sustainability and design for well-being. Howell, Stark, et al (2016) teaches that multiple design fields May be employed in tandem to explore human centered design projects. This mindset allows for more holistic design solutions. When students are introduced to this framework, they are opened up to more flexibility in their design process and potential solutions. This paper outlines an industrial design studentÕs self-directed thesis project on encouraging self-compassionate thought patterns. We will examine how the process was affected by viewing the project as a multidisciplinary design field challenge instead of a traditional form, color and material-driven industrial design challenge. Importantly, the paper will discuss how research and design methods from industrial design, graphic design, interaction design, storytelling, and psychological science played into the creation of a meaningful designed project and experience. The paper concludes with several suggestions for integrating multidisciplinary design methods into classroom practice.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Experimental data from friction stir welded Al 7075 and HSLA-65 were used to create dimensionless, empirical models relating critical weld parameters to the peak temperature rise and cooling rate of the weld heat-affected zone. Five different backing plate materials and a wide range of travel speeds and weld powers were used in the experimental design to ensure the models are relevant to a broad range of welding parameters. The resulting models have R-squared values of 0.997 and 0.995 for the dimensionless peak temperature rise and cooling rate correlations, respectively. Demonstrations of the modelsÕ practical applications are provided. Herein is shown how the models can identify welding parameter (i.e. travel speed or power) levels needed to produce a desired weld peak temperature rise or cooling rate. Also demonstrated is how the models can be used to explore the relative effects of travel speed and backing plate thermal diffusivity on weld peak temperature rise and cooling rate. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Every college student has different needs when it comes to learning. It can be difficult to decide which course is best to take on the road to graduation, and which professor will best suit the student's learning style. CrsRecs, our proposed course/professor recommendation system, makes that process much easier. Using topic analysis, tag analysis, sentiment analysis, predicted course/professor ratings, and survey data revealing student priorities with respect to classes (i.e., easy A, quality of the class, etc.), CrsRecs ranks potential courses in order of perceived preference for the student based on a hybrid technique combining the analysis results of a course. Empirical studies conducted to evaluate the performance of CrsRecs have revealed that CrsRecs not only suggests relevant courses to users by considering all the features of a course, but also outperforms existing state-of-the-art course recommendation approaches. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The results presented in this paper were obtained from a large testing program that was conducted to evaluate the post-liquefaction axial load capacities of three drilled shaft and three driven pile foundations constructed at the Turrell Arkansas testing site (TATS), located within the New Madrid Seismic Zone. An increase of side and toe resistances, significant ground and driven piles and drilled shafts top settlements were observed following blasting. This increase and settlements were attributed to the increase of effective stress as the excess porewater pressure dissipated. The liquefaction-induced dragloads that developed, at the neutral plane ranged from 200 to 650 kN. The load and settlement distribution curves for each installed foundation during the application of load to the top of each foundation and after blasting are also discussed. The induced dragloads represented more than 5 and 10% of the total resistance of the drilled shaft and driven pile foundations, respectively. © ASCE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>The models used during wind farm layout optimization use simplifying assumptions that can alter the design space. Some characteristics of the simple models may negatively influence the resulting layouts. In this paper, we perform wind farm layout optimization using a simple wake model and compare the resulting improvements to large-eddy simulation (LES) results to confirm that the layout was actually improved. We begin by describing the models used, including changes specific for use with gradient-based optimization. We then compare our modelsÕ output to previously published model and LES results. Using the models described, we performed gradient-based wind farm layout optimization using exact gradients. Power production for the original and optimized layouts were recalculated using LES. The model and LES results were then compared. The simple models predicted an improvement in annual energy production (AEP) of 7.4%, while the LES reported an AEP improvement of 9.9%. We concluded that the improvements found by optimizing with the simple models are not just an artifact of the model characteristics, but are real improvements. © 2019 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

        <gf:abstract>We present a method for the design optimization of a soft, inflatable robot. The method described utilizes a multi-objective fitness function together with custom, platform-specific metrics related to the dexterity and load-bearing capacity of inflatable manipulators. Candidate designs are scored by computing these metrics at many randomly generated configurations and then by appropriately combining these scores within the multi-objective optimization framework. High performing designs are propagated through a genetic algorithm. The final result is a set of diverse, optimal designs lying along a Pareto front spanning the design space. By examining variations and trade-offs within this set, a designer can more appropriately choose design parameters for a target application. This is especially relevant for robots with many design parameters that can quickly be manufactured as is the case with emerging, soft robot technologies. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This study was carried out with the intention to create new models to predict the maximum endurance time for the left-side bridge exercise using machine learning methods and hybrid data. Particularly, four different methods including Multilayer Feed-Forward Artificial Neural Network (MFANN), Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) and Single Decision Tree (SDT) have been used for model development. The dataset used to create the prediction models includes physiological, exercise and questionnaire data related to individuals who performed the left-side bridge exercise and completed the Perceived Activity Rating (PAR) and Perceived Functional Ability (PFA) questionnaires. To evaluate the performance of the models, two well-known metrics, namely Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Multiple Correlation Coefficient (R) have been used, whereas the generalization errors have been assessed using 10-fold cross validation. The best prediction performance among the models has been obtained by using MFANN along with the predictor variables gender, age, body mass index (BMI), the times to reach a rate of perceived exertion values of 7 and 8 (RPE-7 and RPE-8, respectively) and PAR, producing the lowest RMSE and the highest R with 10.61 seconds (s) and 0.92, respectively. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This paper applies channel sounding measurements to enable physical-layer security coding. The channel measurements were acquired in an indoor environment and used to assess the secrecy capacity as a function of physical location. A variety of Reed-Muller wiretap codes were applied to the channel measurements to determine the most effective code for the environment. The results suggest that deploying physical-layer security coding is a three-point design process, where channel sounding data guides 1) the physical placement of the antennas, 2) the power settings of the transmitter, and 3) the selection of wiretap coding. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Studio projects increase from simple &amp; straightforward to complex &amp; indeterminate as undergraduate industrial design studentsÕ progress through their educational experiences. As project complexity increases, students are faced with information overload and can struggle to move forward in a meaningful way. Complex Problem Solving studies and Cognitive Load Theory suggest information reduction as a way to grasp the critical aspects of a problem and move beyond the impasse inherent with too much information. Segmentation and chunking are common strategies for information reduction but the abstraction inherent in the chunking process provides better conceptual understanding. The simplified but meaningful results from the chunking process can then be leveraged to create a model or framework that helps students organise and clarify what they have observed as well as point to new opportunities for design activity. Despite the fear of oversimplification, significantly abstracted models have great Òexplanatory or predictive powerÓ and can lead to rich results. Reviewing the concepts of complexity, cognitive load, and contrasting segmentation with data chunking, this paper will then highlight a portion of a student project where information reduction provided understanding beyond initial student impressions and encouraged them to move forward. © 2018 Institution of Engineering Designers The Design Society.

    <gf:abstract>Near-to-eye holographic displays act to directly project wavefronts into a viewer's eye in order to recreate 3-D scenes for augmented or virtual reality applications. Recently, several solutions for near-to-eye electroholography have been proposed based on digital spatial light modulators in conjunction with supporting optics, such as holographic waveguides for light delivery; however, such schemes are limited by the inherent low space-bandwidth product available with current digital SLMs. In this paper, we depict a fully monolithic, integrated optical platform for transparent near-to-eye holographic display requiring no supporting optics. Our solution employs a guided-wave acousto-optic spatial light modulator implemented in lithium niobate in conjunction with an integrated Bragg-regime reflection volume hologram. © 2017 SPIE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This work presents two novel support systems used to help mitigate flexible device buckling during insertion such as the insertion of medical device into the body. These systems are collapsible to accommodate the changing length of the flexible device as it is inserted. They use tension in wires or geometry to provide systems with lateral stiffness used to support the device. Through modeling, the performance of these systems can be predicted and they can be designed to a desired performance. This was validated in the geometry-based support system. They provide systems with small operating volumes and part counts. Copyright © 2018 ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>According to current ABET accreditation requirements, engineering students need to become aware of the social contexts of engineering and develop ethical and professional responsibilities during their undergraduate training. Concerns also persist about the moral and ethical commitments of engineers once they enter the workplace, as underscored by a number of recent ethics scandals involving engineers and technology. The education of ethically adept engineers therefore remains a pertinent issue for the engineering education community. Yet there remains relatively little research on how students' prior experiences shape their ethical perspectives. Specifically, there is a lack of understanding of the role of pre-college and early college experiences and other influences in shaping first-year engineering students' views on ethics. This paper reports select results from an NSF-funded project aiming to address some of these gaps in the literature. This longitudinal study was conducted across four universities and focused on the ethical development of undergraduate engineering students. Preliminary analysis of interviews from the first phase of this study identified a number of major themes in the data set, two of which are important to highlight here: 1) influences on students' ethical perspectives (e.g., academic curricular, extracurricular activities, family, etc.) and 2) learned outcomes, defined as insights, learning, or realizations related to ethics, morality, and values. Deeper investigation of the relationship between specific influences and students' insights related to ethics can provide a better understanding of first-year engineering students' baseline ethical development. The goal of this paper is to characterize what specific ethical lessons are gained through various types of experiences, as well as to glean how this learning and growth occurs. Data for this study was drawn from 66 interview transcripts and consisted of sections coded simultaneously for influences and learned outcomes. The cross-coded data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. The types of influences impacting students' ethical learning, and exemplars of how students report their lived experiences and ethical realizations, are discussed through the lens of what they learned and the mechanisms through which they gained these understandings. Our analysis suggests that several pre-college (e.g., extracurricular activities, service/volunteer roles and social experiences) and early college experiences (e.g., academic courses, part-time employment) play a critical role in shaping students' ethical perspectives. We more specifically present our findings organized around eight types of experiences and influences, which are in turn related to three categories of learned outcomes and three types of learning mechanisms. As we discuss in more detail below, the results of this study will likely be of interest to engineering educators, policymakers, and researchers with an interest in administering and studying high-impact ethics interventions for undergraduate engineering students. More specifically, our results underscore the importance of being more aware of how students' background perspectives and experiences likely play important roles in enabling or disabling their further ethical development. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Security designs that presume enacting secure behaviors to be beneficial in all circumstances discount the impact of response cost on users' lives and assume that all data is equally worth protecting. However, this has the effect of reducing user autonomy by diminishing the role personal values and priorities play in the decision-making process. In this study, we demonstrate an alternative approach that emphasizes users' comprehension over compliance, with the goal of helping users to make more informed decisions regarding their own security. To this end, we conducted a three-phase redesign of the warning notifications surrounding the authentication ceremony in Signal. Our results show how improved comprehension can be achieved while still promoting favorable privacy outcomes among users. Our experience reaffirms existing arguments that users should be empowered to make personal trade-offs between perceived risk and response cost. We also find that system trust is a major factor in users' interpretation of system determinations of risk, and that properly communicating risk requires an understanding of user perceptions of the larger security ecosystem in whole. © is held by the author/owner.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This paper introduces an odometry-like front-end estimator for GPS-denied fixed-wing flight using a monocular camera. This development is a critical component for enabling fixed-wing aircraft to use a novel methodology called relative navigation. Relative navigation allows a single vehicle to gracefully accommodate intermittent GPS or geo-registered image updates. It can also enable communication and a computationally feasible cooperative, batch-based navigation approach for numerous vehicles. This paper presents a visual-odometry estimator that is appropriate for fixed-wing flight characteristics and sensing requirements. We propose a modification to the multi-state-constraint Kalman filter which, instead of running the filter in a single inertial/global frame, regularly resets the navigation frame to a new local origin. The vehicle operates based on the most recent keyframe and produces a marginalized change in pose (odometry) and covariance output whenever the keyframe is updated. This allows the front end to operate at the IMU rate to accommodate guidance and control inputs while sharing marginalized keyframe-to-keyframe odometry estimates with a back-end, graph optimization at a much lower rate than traditional batch navigation schemes. Results from testing the proposed method in a high-fidelity simulation of the filter is also presented. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Research on oxy-coal combustion has heretofore primarily focused on retrofit, or near retrofit, applications, where flame temperatures or heat transfer profiles under oxy-firing are similar to those under air firing. These profiles are modulated using recycled flue gas that acts as the diluent normally served by nitrogen during air firing. The large amounts of recycled flue gas (RFG) required leads to efficiency losses, making the economics of this process less attractive. Oxy-coal combustion economics can be improved in advanced oxy-combustion processes that may involve zero or minimal RFG and possibly high combustion pressures. This paper addresses effects of high combustion temperatures resulting from minimal RFG, on ash aerosol formation and ash deposition mechanisms. Issues related to ash deposition play important roles in being able to predict overall boiler performance. Effects of high pressure will be reported in future work. A 100kW downfired laboratory combustor is used to compare ash aerosol formation and deposition under two conditions: 1) using 27% O2 in the inlet oxidant gas (denoted as OXY27), representing first generation oxy-combustion (heat transfer conditions similar to air firing for retrofit); 2) with 70% O2 in the inlet oxidant gas (denoted as OXY70), representing advanced oxy-combustion where the RFG is used only to transport the coal, not to modulate flame temperatures. The ash aerosol particle size distributions and its size segregated composition were determined using on-line electric mobility/light scattering analyzers and low pressure impactors, respectively. Their relationship to ash deposition rates as determined using a specially designed deposition probe was explored. The data show that, compared to the retrofit conditions of OXY27, the advanced oxy-coal combustion in OXY70 produce much higher concentrations of submicron particles due to increased mineral vaporization at the high flame temperature and the decreased flue gas flow rate. This appeared to lead to significant increases in deposition rates. Changes in the supermicron particle concentration were in line with those expected by the lower flue gas alone, suggesting that mineral fragmentation is not greatly affected by temperature. Deposition rates of both inside and outside deposits, as defined in earlier work, are interpreted in the light of recently developed hypotheses that point to the importance of the submicron particle ash concentration. © 2017 Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute.

        <gf:abstract>This work presents a multiplicative extended Kalman filter (MEKF) for estimating the relative state of a multirotor vehicle operating in a GPS-denied environment. The filter fuses data from an inertial measurement unit and altimeter with relative-pose updates from a keyframe-based visual odometry or laser scan-matching algorithm. Because the global position and heading states of the vehicle are unobservable in the absence of global measurements such as GPS, the filter in this article estimates the state with respect to a local frame that is colocated with the odometry keyframe. As a result, the odometry update provides nearly direct measurements of the relative vehicle pose, making those states observable. Recent publications have rigorously documented the theoretical advantages of such an observable parameterization, including improved consistency, accuracy, and system robustness, and have demonstrated the effectiveness of such an approach during prolonged multirotor flight tests. This article complements this prior work by providing a complete, self-contained, tutorial derivation of the relative MEKF, which has been thoroughly motivated but only briefly described to date. This article presents several improvements and extensions to the filter while clearly defining all quaternion conventions and properties used, including several new useful properties relating to error quaternions and their Euler-angle decomposition. Finally, this article derives the filter both for traditional dynamics defined with respect to an inertial frame, and for robocentric dynamics defined with respect to the vehicleÕs body frame, and provides insights into the subtle differences that arise between the two formulations. © The Author(s) 2020.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This research is designed to make progress in overcoming the challenges through the development of a two-stage coal processing. Specifically, a two-stage process was used to maximize the use of the carbon in coal or increase the carbon monoxide yield or lower carbon dioxide and methane yields. Carbon dioxide-char gasification in the absence of water can generate carbon monoxide with near-zero methane, which is desired to produce high-carbon and low-hydrogen chemicals such as oxalic acid through catalytic carbon monoxide coupling and hydrolysis. The technology is applicable to any coal, although Power River Basin (PRB) coal is used as an example feedstock in this research Also, the sodium-iron catalyst can accelerate not only the reaction kinetics in both stages but also increase the hydrogen/carbon monoxide ratio in the syngas produced in the second stage. In other words, the catalyst is a multifunctional agent, which can not only intensify the overall coal process efficiency but also improve the qualities of the desired syngas products and reduce carbon dioxide emission. Thus, In the 1st stage, the catalysts can significantly reduce the CO2-char gasification by as high as 75.00%. In the 2nd stage, the H2/CO ratio of ideal syngas is _2:1 with near-0 CH4 generation and the CH4 production can be reduced as high as 61.29% for the CO2ÐH2O-Char coal gasification. The activation energy for the 2nd stage is reduced by as high as 35.43% than that of raw coal without use NaÐFe catalyst. The overall carbon footprint reduction for the study is reduced by 87.33% in the 1st stage and 96.77% compared to the direct coal combustion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Seismic hazard in Mexico City governed by site effects. The M8.1 1985 subduction zone earthquake, which caused significant damage and loss of thousands of lives at 350 km epicentral distance, has become the quintessential example of the role that site effects can play in modifying the amplitude, frequency, and duration of ground shaking; and in aggravating the catastrophic consequences of earthquakes. We here present observations and analyses of the M7.1 September 19, 2017, event that -while triggered by an intraplate rupture at approximately half the epicentral distance of the 1985 event relative to Mexico City -caused severe structural damage to a few tens of buildings located in a relatively narrow zone between the hill and lake zones of the basin, known as the transition zone. We show that the M 7.1 mainshock exposed the vulnerabilities of the pre-1985 building code in the transition zone; but more importantly highlighted the improvement of the 1987 building code revision in terms of the performance of modern high-rise buildings that suffered catastrophic consequences during the 1985 Michocan earthquake sequence. We next analyze several records collected at stations in the basin over the past 20 years. We highlight the importance of three-dimensional heterogeneity of the basin sediments, the coupling between hydrological setting and site response and their evolution with time, and the energy interaction between the deep basin edge and the shallow clay layers.

        <gf:abstract>The growth of STEM career occupations is outpacing the college enrollment of STEM students in the United States. There have been many research projects investigating this issue. There has not however been a study which investigated the impact non-fiction literature has on student interest in studying STEM (specifically engineering) content. The purpose of this study was to investigate the change of student attitudes toward engineering after reading literature involving non-fiction engineering centric narratives. The study used a modified version of the PATT (Pupils Attitudes Towards Technology) called the TEAS (Technology and Engineering Attitudes Scale) to measure student attitude change. The students were high-school aged students in the United States (ages: 15Ð17) who were enrolled in an English Literature course. The students completed the TEAS before and after reading and studying two engineering and technology centric non-fiction books (The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind and October Sky). The data revealed that student attitude after reading and studying the two books did not statistically change. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The processes involved in bed-load sediment transport are complex and difficult to quantify. Field measurements provide insight and a chance to improve predictive methods. A comprehensive database is described that contains more than 15,000 observations from nearly 500 data sets of bed-load sediment transport. Observations are compiled from published sources, author responses to queries, and personal visits to offices. Each entry has been checked twice for accuracy against the original data and converted to a common set of units. The database contains sections for sample descriptions, discharge and transport data, channel and bankfull characteristics, surface and subsurface grain size distributions, and, where possible, stream classification descriptors. Discharges range from far below to several times bankfull values. The database is freely available to the public and may be accessed via direct download and through WaterML based web services from the BYU World Water Data Sediment Transport Database portal at http://worldwater.byu.edu/app/index.php/sediment. The intent of this database is to provide useful data to researchers as they continue to investigate bed-load transport processes. Data can be added to the database by contacting the authors. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>An 8-bit 10-GHz 8_ time-interleaved SAR ADC in 28-nm CMOS incorporates an aggressively scaled DAC with grouped capacitors in a symmetrical comb structure to afford a threefold reduction in the bottom-plate parasitic capacitance. A dual-path bootstrapped switch decouples critical signal from nonlinear capacitance to boost the sampling SFDR by more than 5 dB. The ADC demonstrates an SNDR of 36.9 dB at Nyquist while consuming 21 mW,yielding an FoM of 37 fJ/conv.-step,the lowest among the reported ADCs with similar speeds and resolutions and more than 2_ improvement from the state-of-the-art. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>An origami-based engineering approach is applied to the folding design of tensioned precision space structures. Tension is a viable means of stiffening a flat antenna aperture, especially when stowed volume is paramount. Three folding patterns are described, and the design guidelines are developed. Deployment kinematics follow the simplicity of a single-degree-of-freedom mechanism for two of the three patterns. The panels are rigid, and articulations occur along the prescribed lines. These deployment architectures are compatible with storable tubular extendible member booms, articulated trusses, or continuous longeron coilable trusses, all commonly used to deploy spacecraft structures. High areal packaging densities were demonstrated: 1.0 m2_l for a diamond pattern with a high deployed aspect ratio and 0.5 m2_l for spiral and serpentine patterns compatible with high and low deployed aspect ratios. A double-layer material hinge method is also presented and used to enable the structures to fold, deploy, and be tensioned to a planar state.

        <gf:abstract>In addition to developing technically competent engineers, engineering programs aim to prepare students to be professionally and ethically responsible. Universities have sought to integrate ethics instruction into their curricula through a variety of learning experiences. However, there is a lack of research on foundational understandings of social and ethical responsibility among engineering students, including how their perceptions change over time and following participation in specific types of learning experiences. This study uses a longitudinal mixed-methods study design, collecting and analyzing quantitative and qualitative data from engineering students over the course of their four years as undergraduate students. This paper reports insights gained by a repeat survey of student perceptions of ethics and social responsibility. Our analysis compares student responses (n=319) to a survey administered during their first year of college and again in their junior year (approximately fifth-semester), including variations based on student affiliations and demographics (e.g., comparisons among universities, genders, importance of religion, and other relevant factors) and learning experiences (e.g., service-learning programs, ethics courses, extracurricular organizations, etc.). These mid-point findings contribute to our understandings of the trajectories of students' perceptions and perspectives and are beginning to reveal some specific experiences and contexts that are having the largest measurable impacts on the participating students. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The mechanical properties of origami tessellations may provide innovative new designs for energy absorbing applications. The elastic energy absorbing properties of a particular tesselation, the Miura-ori, is investigated. Analytical models for the kinematics and force-deflection of a unit cell based on two different modes of elastic energy absorption are derived. The force-deflection model is developed based on the application of compliant mechanism theory and virtual work analysis. The models are verified through comparison with published results for similar models, analysis using commercial kinematics software and comparison to physical testing. Physical prototypes are used to determine values stiffness terms. The analytical models are used to explore the effects of the key geometrical parameters of the tessellation. This work lays a foundation for the use of origami-based corrugations in elastic energy absorption applications. Copyright © 2017 ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Approximately 6 million acres per year are burned by prescribed fire shrublands in the southeastern United States. Burning the understory every 2-4 years prevents fires from spreading to the canopy. However, combustion of live shrubs is not well understood, and has been shown to differ from combustion of dead biomass fuels. The purpose of this study is to investigate pyrolysis products from live shrub fuels. The pyrolysis products constitute the fuel for the gaseous flames in a fire. Amounts of pyrolyzed species depend on heating rate, temperature, fuel type, and fuel properties. In order to provide pyrolysis conditions and oxygen-free environment, a flat-flame burner (FFB) was designed and operated in a fuel-rich mode. Hot and cold traps were used to separate low and high molecular weight (tars) pyrolysis products and then analyzed in two different GC-MS systems. The data obtained help focus modeling efforts for combustion of live shrubs. © 2017 Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute. All rights reserved.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This work discusses the development and use of a detailed 3D radiative heat transfer model of a rotary kiln with a present bed material, used for iron ore pelletizing. A discrete ordinates method is used to solve the radiative heat transfer equation with radiative properties calculated using a weighted-sum-of-grey-gases (WSGG) model for gases and Mie and Rayleigh theory for particles including fuel, ash and soot. Measurement data gathered from a pilot-scale test furnace, comprising temperature, gas composition and particle concentration, is used in combination with temperature data and operation parameters gathered from a conventional rotary kiln to model a full-scale rotary kiln with a present bed material. The modelled cases have a thermal input of about 37 MWth and in addition to radiative heat transfer, conductive heat transfer within, as well as between, the bed and wall material are included in the model along with convective heat transfer from the gas and heat release from exothermic reactions in the bed. The model also considers the rotational wall and includes a simplified mixing model of the bed material as well as heat losses from the outside wall of the rotary kiln due to radiation and convection. For two different flames, one coal and one oil flame, surface temperatures are calculated on the inside and outside of the rotary kiln and compared to measurements. The model appears to predict the inner wall and bed surface temperatures well with errors less than 11%. The total heat transfer to the present bed material was also studied revealing that more than 80% originated from the radiative heat transfer within the furnace. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Many space applications are considering the use of commercial SRAM-based FPGAs over radiation hardened devices. When using SRAM-based FPGAs, soft processors may be required to fulfill application requirements, but the FPGA designs must overcome radiation-induced soft errors to provide a reliable system. TMR is one solution in designing a fault tolerant soft processor to mitigate the failures caused by SEUs. This paper compares the neutron soft-error reliability of an unmitigated and TMR version of a Taiga RISC-V soft processor on a Xilinx SRAM-based FPGA. The TMR RISC-V processor showed a 33_ reduction in the neutron cross section and a 27% decrease in operational frequency, resulting in a 24_ improvement of the mean work to failure with a cost of around 5.6_ resource utilization. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This paper demonstrates the use of nonlinear dynamic optimization to calculate energy-optimal trajectories for a high-altitude, solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The objective is to maximize the total energy in the system while staying within a 3 km mission radius and meeting other system constraints. Solar energy capture is modeled using the vehicle orientation and solar position, and energy isstored both in batteries and in potential energy through elevation gain. Energy capture is maximized by optimally adjusting the angle of the aircraft surface relative to the sun. The UAV flight and energy system dynamics are optimized over a 24h period at an 8s time resolution using nonlinear model predictive control. Results of the simulated flights are presented for all four seasons, showing an 8.2% increase in end-of-day battery energy for the most limiting flight condition of the winter solstice. © 2018 by R.

    <gf:abstract>In todayÕs rapidly evolving design disciplines, design history students should demonstrate an understanding of the social and cultural impact of design of both historical and contemporary designers and their methods. To increase student engagement with design history and discourse, we prototyped a new format for our design history course in Brigham Young UniversityÕs Industrial Design department. Our goal was to enable students to process designs they encounter, both in person and social media, through a critical and cultural perspective, and then turn those lenses towards their own design work with greater social and cultural awareness. To do this, we utilized Instagram as the primary platform (@byudesignhistory) for course discussion and altered the way we framed student assignments. This new curriculum was prototyped in the spring of 2018. Outcomes were measured by monitoring student engagement, responses, and comprehension scores on verbal and written assignments and examinations. Students also responded to a series of reviews to gather their perspectives on the class. Results indicate an increase in their understanding of the cultural position design holds in a way that was absent in student results from the previous course structure. If our course interventions are effective, students should move from concrete to abstract knowledge as well as from lower order to higher order thinking skills. Students will thus be better prepared to assess, understand and discuss both current and historical design cultures and trends while influencing their own design work through an informed perspective. © 2018 Institution of Engineering Designers The Design Society.

        <gf:abstract>Understanding how people behave when faced with complex security situations is essential to designing usable security tools. To better understand users' perceptions of their digital lives and how they managed their online security posture, we conducted a series of 23 semi-structured interviews with mostly middle-aged parents from suburban Washington state. Using a grounded theory methodology, we analyzed the interview data and found that participants chose their security posture based on the immense value the Internet provides and their belief that no combination of technology could make them perfectly safe. Within this context, users have a four-stage process for determining which security measures to adopt: learning, evaluation of risks, estimation of impact, and weighing trade-offs to various coping strategies. Our results also revealed that a majority of participants understand the basic principles of symmetric encryption. We found that participants' misconceptions related to browser-based TLS indicators lead to insecure behavior, and it is the permanence of encrypted email that causes participants to doubt that it is secure. We conclude with a discussion of possible responses to this research and avenues for future research. © 2017 by The USENIX Association. All rights reserved.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This paper introduces a new algorithm for estimating the relative pose of a moving camera using consecutive frames of a video sequence. State-of-the-art algorithms for calculating the relative pose between two images use matching features to estimate the essential matrix. The essential matrix is then decomposed into the relative rotation and normalized translation between frames. To be robust to noise and feature match outliers, these methods generate a large number of essential matrix hypotheses from randomly selected minimal subsets of feature pairs, and then score these hypotheses on all feature pairs. Alternatively, the algorithm introduced in this paper calculates relative pose hypotheses by directly optimizing the rotation and normalized translation between frames, rather than calculating the essential matrix and then performing the decomposition. The resulting algorithm improves computation time by an order of magnitude. If an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is available, it is used to seed the optimizer, and in addition, we reuse the best hypothesis at each iteration to seed the optimizer thereby reducing the number of relative pose hypotheses that must be generated and scored. These advantages greatly speed up performance and enable the algorithm to run in real-time on low cost embedded hardware. We show application of our algorithm to visual multi-target tracking (MTT) in the presence of parallax and demonstrate its real-time performance on a 640 480 video sequence captured on a UAV. © 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Magnesium and magnesium-based alloys have relatively low weight and desirable mechanical properties for many applications in multiple industries including aerospace and automotive. In the past decade, due to its biocompatible nature, the medical field has expressed significant interest in magnesium for biodegradable implant applications. However, utilization of magnesium-based alloys in surgical implant applications is strictly limited by magnesiumÕs high vulnerability to corrosion causing premature disintegration inside the human body. Hydrophobic (non-wetting) behavior of metal surfaces has been proven to be beneficial for corrosion protection in academic literature. One way of achieving hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces on metal surfaces without using non-biocompatible coatings is creating uniform microstructures that would alter the wetting characteristics of the surface. This work focuses on creating uniform pillar shaped micro-patterns on smooth pure magnesium surfaces by utilizing a picosecond laser (_ = 355 nm). The study reports the effects of average laser power, partial laser beam overlap and number of laser scans on the height, steepness, roughness of the resultant micro-pillars. Information gathered from this study could be useful in creating more complex or finer micro-structures on magnesium and its alloys to alter their wetting or corrosion characteristics using laser ablation which is a fast, repeatable and an un-convoluted process.

    <gf:abstract>This work enables GPS-denied flight on fixed-wing UAS by accounting for fixed-wing-specific sensing requirements and using a methodology called relative navigation as an overarching framework. The development of an odometry-like, front-end, EKF-based estimator that utilizes only a monocular camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is presented. The filter uses the measurement model of the multi-state-constraint Kalman filter. The filter also regularly resets its origin in coordination with the declaration of keyframe images. The keyframe-to-keyframe odometry estimates and their covariances are sent to a global back end that represents the global state as a pose graph. The back end is better suited to represent nonlinear uncertainties and incorporate opportunistic global constraints. We also introduce a method to account for front-end velocity bias in the back-end optimization. The paper provides simulation and hardware flight-test results of the front-end estimator and performs several back-end optimizations on the front-end data. © 2020 Institute of Navigation</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>With the growing popularity of small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), there is a significant need to enable small UAS to detect and avoid collisions with both manned and unmanned aircraft. The capabilities of ADS-B make it an attractive sensor for detect and avoid (DAA), but it is susceptible to frequency congestion. This paper quantitatively analyzes the frequency limitations of 978 MHz ADS-B. It then uses these limitations to make a recommendation for well clear in ADS-B-equipped airspace that has a high density of small UAS operations. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

    <gf:abstract>For over a century, teacher preparation programs (TPPs) have experienced peaks and valleys in preparing preservice teachers to deliver technology and engineering (TE) experiences in elementary classrooms. Calls to integrate engineering concepts into elementary education (Katehi, Pearson, &amp; Feder, 2009; Kimmel, Carpinelli, Curr-Alexander, &amp; Rockland, 2006)Ñespecially as it relates to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS; NGSS Lead States, 2013) and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) educationÑcompels TE teacher educators to evaluate their curricular programs relative to elementary education. To assist teacher educators in this selfassessment, the Teacher Preparation Committee of the Council on Technology and Engineering Teacher Education undertook a mixed methods study, the purpose of which was to identify and characterize the models of teacher preparation programs that prepared preservice elementary teachers to deliver TE experiences in elementary classrooms. © 2017, Virginia Polytechnic Institute.

        <gf:abstract>A major barrier, preventing RFSSW from use by manufacturers, is the long cycle time that has been historically associated with making a weld. In order for RFSSW to become a readily implementable welding solution, cycle times must be reduced to an acceptable level, similar to that of well developed, competing spot joining processes. In the present work, an investigation of the RFSSW process is conducted to evaluate factors that have traditionally prevented the process from achieving fast cycle times. Within this investigation, the relationship between cycle time and joint quality is explored, as is the meaning and measurement of cycle time in the RFSSW process. Claims and general sentiment found in prior literature are challenged regarding the potential for high-speed RFSSW joints to be made. The RFSSW weld design-as described by process parameters such as tool feed rate, tool rotational velocity, and plunge depth-is shown through experimentation to affect the loads and torques placed on RFSSW tooling and machines during the welding process. As cycle time is decreased, the load and torque on the toolset are shown to increase. Similarly, as tool rotational velocity is decreased, the load and torque on the toolset is shown to increase. The relationship between machine design limitations and cycle time is also explored. It is demonstrated that welds with cycle times below one second can be produced without compromising material properties, suggesting that high speed RFSSW can be enabled through informed efforts. © 2020 SAE International.

    <gf:abstract>COllaborative DEsign in Virtual Environment (CODEVE) is a teaching methodology developed within the European Global Product Realisation (EGPR) course over a number of years. It was developed to establish suitable teaching practice to educate students on efficient design methods in a distributed product realisation projects in conjunction with an industrial partner. Students work in international teams formed from multiple partner universities. Communication is primarily through video-conferencing and other synchronous and asynchronous means of communication to perform design tasks including the vision, conceptual design, detail design and prototyping. Students ultimately meet during the final workshop at the end of the course to assemble and test prototypes and to disseminate their work to the company and wider public. The CODEVE methodology was tested in the Erasmus+ funded project called Networked Activities for Realisation of Innovative Products (NARIP) from 2015-2107. It has been implemented in academic institution in Europe. This paper discusses applicability of this methodology in the project which connects universities and industry across the Atlantic. Three universities are participating this year: Brigham Young University from Utah, USA with Industrial Design students, University of Technology and Economics of Budapest in Hungary with product design students and City, University of London from the UK with mechanical, aeronautical and electrical engineering students. The industrial partner is Black Diamond, a global company based in Utah, USA, while the manufacturing of prototypes and final workshop are hosted at City, University of London. Time difference, culture and the discipline of study make implementation of CODEVE methodology in this transatlantic project more difficult than if the project is kept within European Universities. This paper outlines challenges and learning outcomes of students on both sides of Atlantic. Recommendations to modifications in CODEVE methodology to suit transatlantic projects are discussed in the paper. © 2018 Institution of Engineering Designers The Design Society.

        <gf:abstract>This paper presents on thermally induced atomization dynamics during liquid water droplet impingement on superheated hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces. Circular micropillars 4 _m in height with varying center-to-center distances (pitch) of 8 _m, 12 _m and 16 _m, are used to create the superhydrophobic surfaces. The range of surface temperatures explored is 110¡C&amp;lt;Ts&amp;lt;337¡C. An image processing algorithm was developed to quantify the temporal behavior of thermally induced atomization captured via high-speed photography. Results show thermally induced atomization is initially absent (&amp;lt;1 ms following impact) on all surfaces. The amount of ejected droplets later during droplet spreading is determined as a function of surface structuring and temperature. Atomization ceases when the surface has cooled sufficiently (2.5Ð4 ms depending on the surface). The maximum amount of atomization for a given scenario is highly dependent on surface temperature and surface microstructure characteristics. At low surface temperatures, atomization increases with increasing surface temperature; however at high surface temperatures atomization decreases with increasing surface temperature. This rise and fall behavior is tantamount to the classical relationship between heat flux and surface temperature for pool boiling. Both droplet impingement and pool boiling depend on vapor bubble formation dynamics and the stability of the so-called Leidenfrost vapor film, which is impacted by surface wettability. Results also show that small surface pitch causes a high atomization intensity, indicating that not all superhydrophobic surfaces sustain Leidenfrost-like behavior at all excess temperatures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>High resolution wide bandwidth applications require power-efficient high-accuracy data converters. Multi-Stage Noise-Shaping (MASH) is a useful technique for the design of stable high-order ?S modulators. In this paper, we propose a two-step MASH incremental ADC (IADC). In the first step it performs a third-order coarse quantization. Re-using the same hardware, in the second step the circuit performs fine quantization as a second-order IADC. Thus, it achieves fifth-order noise shaping with only three amplifiers. For a low oversampling ratio OSR = 32, the signal-to-noise ratio can be boosted by about 30 dB. The scheme is suitable for wide bandwidth applications. © 2020 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Employee turnover is a continuing challenge in the construction industry with negative effects on construction companies. Other industries have begun using personality profile assessments as a tool for reducing employee turnover, and more specifically in their hiring, promoting, team building, and leadership development processes. However, it was unknown if this trend was effecting the construction industry. The purpose of this research was to determine if and how U.S. commercial construction companies utilize personality profiles in their employee retention processes. A survey was randomly sent to 235 of the top 400 commercial construction companies in the United States to determine if these companies were using assessments, and if it had any effect on the turnover within these companies. Interviews were conducted over the phone with human resources representatives from these companies, and responses were sorted into similar themes and ideas using qualitative pattern coding techniques. Of the 78 responding companies, one-third were using employee personality profiles within their business practices. This article reports the experiences and general attitudes for both the companies that do and do not utilize personality profiles. The results of this research provides strong evidence that using personality profile assessments can help construction companies reduce employee turnover. © 2017 Associated Schools of Construction.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This paper presents the results of two case studies regarding the wind farm layout optimization problem. We asked members of the computational optimization and wind communities to take part in the studies that we designed. Nine individuals participated. Case study 1 considered variations in optimization strategies for a given simple Gaussian wake model. Participants were provided with a wake model that outputs annual energy production (AEP) for an input set of wind turbine locations. Participants used an optimization method of their choosing to find an optimal wind farm layout. Case study 2 looked at trade-offs in performance resulting from variation in both physics model and optimization strategy. For case study 2, participants calculated AEP using a wake model of their choice while also using their chosen optimization method. Participants then used their wake model to calculate the AEP of all other participantsÕ optimized layouts. Results for case study 1 show that the best optimal wind farm layouts in this study were achieved by participants who used gradient-based optimization methods. A front-runner emerged with the Sparse Nonlinear OPTimizer plus Wake Expansion Continua-tion (SNOPT+WEC) optimization method, which consistently discovered the highest submitted AEP. For case study 2, two participants found a similar layout that was judged to be superior by all five participants. It is unclear if the better solution resulted from an improved optimization process, or a wake model that was more amenable to optimization. © 2019 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

        <gf:abstract>The paper summarizes the single-event upset (SEU) results obtained from neutron testing on the UltraScale+ MPSoC ZU9EG device. This complex device contains a large amount of programmable logic and multiple processor cores. Tests were performed on the programmable logic and the processing system simultaneously. Estimates of the single-event upset neutron cross section were obtained for the programmable logic CRAM, BRAM, OCM memory, and cache memories. During the test, no processor crashes or silent data corruptions were observed. In addition, a processor failure cross section was estimated for several software benchmark operating on the various processor cores. Several FPGA CRAM scrubbers were tested including an external JTAG, the Xilinx 'SEM' IP, and the use of the PCAP operating in baremetal. In parallel with these tests, single-event induced high current events were monitored using an external power supply and monitoring scripts. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The objective of this work was to develop an automated air-coupled impact-echo testing device for mapping the occurrence of delamination in a concrete bridge deck from a continuously moving platform with a fast, repeatable excitation mechanism and algorithms for collecting and analyzing the acoustic data. The apparatus developed in this research included an impactor unit, a moving platform, a microphone for air-coupled sensing, a distance measurement instrument, and signal processing modules. Given the absence of an existing universal threshold for differentiating among intact and delaminated areas using the new device, a delamination detection threshold value was determined in a first field demonstration also involving chain dragging and coring of a concrete bridge deck. While the maps of the air-coupled impact-echo data and chain-dragging data exhibit a high degree of similarity and are highly consistent with the results of coring, a quantitative method of comparison also demonstrates the utility of the new device across a broad range of delamination percentages. Specifically, the results indicate that the percentage of the deck area determined to be delaminated using impact-echo testing was within 3 percentage points of that determined to be delaminated using chain dragging for 10 of the 13 deck test sections, which generally exhibited delamination percentages ranging from 7 to 21%. Finally, testing with the new device was more than seven times faster than chain dragging. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Inducers are used as a first stage in pumps to minimize cavitation and allow the pump to operate at lower inlet head conditions. Inlet flow recirculation or backflow in the inducer occurs at low flow conditions and can lead to instabilities and cavitation-induced head breakdown. Backflow of an inducer with a tip clearance (TC) of _ = 0.32% and with no tip clearance (NTC) is examined with a series of computational fluid dynamics simulations. Removing the TC eliminates tip leakage flow; however, backflow is still observed. In fact, the NTC case showed a 37% increase in the length of the upstream backflow penetration. Tip leakage flow does instigate a smaller secondary leading edge tip vortex that is separate from the much larger backflow structure. A comprehensive analysis of these simulations suggests that blade inlet diffusion, not tip leakage flow, is the fundamental mechanism leading to the formation of backflow. © 2019 by ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Practice is of the essence in Engineering courses. A relevant question in control engineering education is: How to close the gap between theory and practice? Once subjects are introduced in theoretical classes, students want to know about its practical use. Thus, it is important to introduce theoretical control concepts with practical experiments, enabling students to easily test and validate the theory. An Arduino based temperature control laboratory (TCLab) is deployed in this study as a portable kit providing students with a simple and effective means to test some feedback control techniques. Teaching/learning experiments are proposed involving proportional, integral and derivative controllers with Feedforward and Cascade control structures.

        <gf:abstract>Computer-based facial recognition algorithms exploit the unique characteristics of faces in images. However, in non-cooperative situations these unique characteristics are often disturbed. In this study, we examine the effect of six different factors on face detection in an unconstrained imaging environment: Image brightness, image contrast, focus measure, eyewear, gender, and occlusion. The aim of this study is twofold: First, to quantify detection rates of conventional Haar cascade algorithms across these six factors; and second, to propose methods for automatically labeling datasets whose size prohibits manual labeling. First, we manually classify a uniquely challenging dataset comprising 9,688 images of passengers in vehicles acquired from a roadside camera system. Next, we quantify how each of the aforementioned factors affect face detection on this dataset. Of the six factors studied, occlusion had the most significant impact, resulting in a 54% decrease in detection rate between unoccluded and severely occluded faces in our unique dataset. Finally, we provide a methodology for data analytics of large datasets where manual labeling of the whole dataset is not possible. © 2018 SPIE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Background: Many MEMS and optical sensor devices can benefit from layers that block transmission and suppress reflection of light across the visible spectrum. Because these devices can include complicated topography, many existing methods for depositing antireflective layers are difficult, impractical, or unusable. Aim: To create a light-blocking antireflective layer that works well with complicated MEMS and sensor devices, a layer should be made that is cheap, simple, and can be deposited and patterned with high resolution at low temperatures. Approach: Light blocking is achieved using an aluminum layer. Suppressing reflection is achieved by mixing aluminum oxide nanoparticles in photoresist to create a layer that partially absorbs and partially scatters light. Results: The combination of a layer of metal and a layer of nanoparticles and photoresist completely blocks transmission of light and significantly reduces reflections across the visible spectrum, particularly for shorter wavelengths. The layer is also patternable to sizes as small as a few microns with high resolution. Conclusion: By combining a metal layer and a layer of nanoparticles in photoresist, a simple, cheap, and effective light-blocking antireflective layer can be created that is compatible with planar devices with complex topography. © 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>With the pressure to provide excellent services under constrained budgets, utilities are adopting asset management as the synergistic framework combining strategic and financial planning, levels of service, and risk-based analysis to determine investments. GIS (geographic information system) helps to empower a utility with the tools to drive a robust and strategic, decision making process. When a CMMS (computerized maintenance management system) has asset management functionality, the capabilities of service requests, inspections and work orders, capturing costs, and work history can be leveraged into asset condition and risk-based spatial analysis by determining what, when, why, and where the next round of investment should occur. A critical step in the process includes analyzing the data and location to potential take actions to reduce the risks. In alignment with ISO (International Standards Organization) 55000, risk is defined as the probability of failure (PoF) multiplied by the consequence of failure (CoF) which produces the business risk exposure (BRE). While calculating risk is important, the risk-based data can be used to build business cases and determine future projects. GIS can help users gain an understanding of what assets are high risk, where they are located and what factor can influence the risk. Risk-based analysis provides the reasoning for potential solutions and action. This paper defines and explores the use of GIS-centric analysis tools to enhance the asset management decision making process. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Ensuring that deployable mechanisms are sufficiently rigid is a major challenge due to their large size relative to their mass. This paper examines three basic types of stiffener that can be applied to light, origami-inspired structures to manage their stiffness. These stiffeners are modeled analytically to enable prediction and optimization of their behavior. The results obtained from this analysis are compared to results from a finite-element analysis and experimental data. After verifying these models, the advantages and disadvantages of each stiffener type are considered. This comparison will facilitate stiffener selection for future engineering applications.

    <gf:abstract>Modern Department of Defense mission systems are very complex and therefore arduous to defend, especially in the cyber domain. A major cause for this concern arises from the fact that implementation of security protections occur at a local scale, while the important operational security issues stem from a global perspective of the system, e.g., mission assurance. Being able to understand network-wide implications of local cyber protections has the potential to significantly impact the strategies we use to protect modern mission systems. In this work, we present a graph-theoretic perspective on this problem, which is based on a framework for modeling and assessing the integrated cyber-physical dynamics of complex systems. Under the framework, these dynamics (and their relationships) are modeled as a graph and then analyzed using processing techniques from graphtheory. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by conducting insider-attack threat analysis and show how the application of security protections at a local scale impact network-wide security properties from an insider perspective. As a test case, we study the problem of search and rescue (SAR) using unmanned aerial vehicle teams. Unmanned vehicle teams engaged in SAR are prototypical cyber-physical systems, in which local intrusions may cause global disruptions. Here, we describe how the insider modeling framework for cyber-physical dynamics applies to this problem and present results of a network-wide assessment of security properties of the system. We use this assessment to design a security protection for the system in which we use cryptographically secure computation techniques to limit the amount of information sharing required between system components without degrading the correct operation of the system. We show how the application of these techniques on a local scale impacts the security properties of the system on a global scale. © 2018 SPIE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>One of the purposes of creating products for developing countries is to improve the consumer's quality of life. Currently, there is no standard method for measuring the social impact of these types of products. As a result, engineers have used their own metrics, if at all. Some of the common metrics used include products sold and revenue, which measure the financial success of a product without recognizing the social successes or failures it might have. In this paper, we introduce a potential universal metric, the product impact metric (PIM), which quantifies the impact a product has on impoverished individuals - especially those living in developing countries. It measures social impact broadly in five dimensions: health, education, standard of living, employment quality, and security. By measuring impact multidimensionally, it captures impacts both anticipated and unanticipated, thereby providing a broader assessment of the product's total impact than with other more specific metrics. The PIM is calculated based on 18 simple field measurements of the consumer. It is inspired by the UN's Multidimensional Poverty Index (UNMPI) created by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The UNMPI measures how level of poverty within a nation changes year after year, and the PIM measures how an individual's poverty level changes after being affected by an engineered product. The PIM can be used to measure social impact (using specific data from products introduced into the market) or predict social impact (using personas that represent real individuals).

        <gf:abstract>The objective of this research was to explore and demonstrate the production and performance of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) rebar manufactured on a continuous three-dimensional braiding machine for use as reinforcement in concrete structures. FRP rebar is generally as strong as steel rebar, but less susceptible to corrosion, providing a significant advantage over traditional steel reinforcement in concrete structures. In this study, a variety of different design configurations of carbon/epoxy composite cylindrical rebar rods were manufactured, embedded in concrete, and tested in axial tension to identify the relationships between manufacturing parameters and tensile pull-out strength of the rebar. The rebar was produced by combining multiple tows of carbon/epoxy prepreg to form the core of cylindrical rods which were consolidated using various spirally-wound consolidation fibers. The rods were cured at 121 degrees Celsius as specified by the material manufacturer, TCR Composites. The manufactured rods were approximately 10.4 mm in diameter. Primary variables investigated included the consolidation fiber material (aramid, fiberglass and basalt), prepreg vs. dry consolidation tows, the number of tows used to consolidate the rebar (i.e., the size of tows used to consolidate the rebar). Larger consolidation tows were created by braiding three smaller tows together. The consolidation tows also served the purpose of providing the rebar with ribs similar to those on steel rebar to improve bonding. Select rebar samples were subsequently coated with sand to increase rebar surface roughness for improved bonding with concrete. The rebar was cast in 200 mm _ 200 mm _ 200 mm concrete cubes to investigate bond strength. The strength of the bond between concrete and FRP rebar was investigated using the pull-out test detailed by ACI 440.3R-12. A test fixture was manufactured to enable testing using a standard tensile testing machine. Standard 12.7 mm diameter steel rebar and a commercially comparable fiberglass rebar were also tested to provide baseline values. Results showed that the bond strength was below 344 MPa (50 ksi) when dry winding was used regardless of whether a single or a multiple tow consolidation bundle was used. Prepreg consolidation combined with sand resulted in a bond strength of 478 MPa (69.3 ksi), comparable to steel at 464 MPa (67.2 ksi). The results demonstrated that consolidating the rods with a wet tow resulted in a rebar which bonded better with concrete than using a dry tow. During testing, it was discovered that dry consolidating materials would easily strip off the rod due to poor bonding. Sand was shown to significantly increase the bond strength of the composite rebar, by more than 30 percent. This study provides the basis for a proposed new low-cost manufacturing method for composite rebar as structural reinforcement in concrete. These preliminary results allowed for a test matrix to be set up where FRP rebar bond strength could be investigated in detail using higher quality samples and more controlled parameters. © 2017 The Composites and Advanced Materials Expo (CAMX).

        <gf:abstract>The construction industry accounts for about one-third of gross capital formation and is ranked as one of the most corrupt. It is a multifaceted industry with unregulated transactions in which illicit behavior can be difficult to detect. The effects of corruption go beyond demoralization associated with bribery, it can lead to substandard quality of infrastructure and insufficient funds available for project maintenance. There are a multitude of reasons identified as possible causes for unethical conduct. A few researchers cited corruption as a result of an unethical decision. Prior research concerning corruption in construction has called for several main strategies: enhanced transparency, ethical codes, project governance, and audit and information technology. However, strategies to combat corruption may not be sufficient. This research first presents an overview of unethical conduct in the industry. Then it examines the ethics in the industry followed by types of relationships and their structure which may be conducive to unethical conduct within the framework of different delivery methods. Finally, an argument is made regarding the importance of strength of relationships in curbing unethical conduct.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Sustainable Energy Solutions has been developing Cryogenic Carbon Captureª(CCC) since 2008. In that time two processes have been developed, the External Cooling Loop and Compressed Flue Gas Cryogenic Carbon Capture processes (CCC ECLª and CCC CFGª respectively). The CCC ECLª process has been scaled up to a 1 TPD CO2 system. In this process the flue gas is cooled by an external refrigerant loop. SES has tested CCC ECLª on real flue gas slip streams from subbituminous coal, bituminous coal, biomass, natural gas, shredded tires, and municipal waste fuels at field sites that include utility power stations, heating plants, cement kilns, and pilot-scale research reactors. The CO2 concentrations from these tests ranged from 5 to 22% on a dry basis. CO2 capture ranged from 95-99+% during these tests. Several other condensable species were also captured including NO2, SO2 and PMxx at 95+%. NO was also captured at a modest rate. The CCC CFGª process has been scaled up to a.25 ton per day system. This system has been tested on real flue gas streams including subbituminous coal, bituminous coal and natural gas at field sites that include utility power stations, heating plants, and pilot-scale research reactors. CO2 concentrations for these tests ranged from 5 to 15% on a dry basis. CO2 capture ranged from 95-99+% during these tests. Several other condensable species were also captured including NO2, SO2 and PMxx at 95+%. NO was also captured at 90+%. Hg capture was also verified and the resulting effluent from CCC CFGª was below a lppt concentration. This paper will focus on discussion of the capabilities of CCC, the results of field testing and the future steps surrounding the development of this technology.

        <gf:abstract>Crackle is a perceptual feature of supersonic jet noise that is related to the presence of acoustic shocks. This study investigates the apparent source locations of events related to crackle for a high-performance military jet aircraft using an event-based, time-domain beamforming method. This method utilizes the cross correlation between adjacent microphones to determine the angle of propagation of an ensemble of shock-related events within the time waveform. This angle of propagation is then traced back towards the source to find the apparent source location. Based on the angle of propagation, derivative skewness, and overall sound pressure level, the microphone pairs along the array can be sorted into six groups. With increasing engine condition, groups related to the presence of crackle tend to shift downstream and broaden, in qualitative agreement with the general aeroacoustic source locations. However, a comparison with near-field acoustical holography shows that the apparent source region of crackle-related events appears upstream of the overall energy at intermediate power but appear to converge at maximum afterburner. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

    <gf:abstract>Sustainability is commonly broken into three categories: Economic, environmental, and social. For products, there is a need for design tools that allow decision makers to handle the tradeoffs between each of these three pillars of sustainability. This paper simultaneously assesses all three pillars of sustainability for the Village Drill, a machine used to dig water wells in rural areas around the world. Using data and methods from Mattson et al. [1, 2] relationships are developed between the drill's design parameters and key sustainability issues. These relationships are used to evaluate the sustainability of the current drill design as well as any alternatives. One million random sets of drill parameters are generated and the resulting drill alternatives are evaluated. A three-dimensional design space for the sustainability of the drill is found and recommendations are given with potential for improvements in each pillar of sustainability. © 2017 ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>The effective security provided by secure messaging applications depends heavily on users completing an authentication ceremony-a sequence of manual operations enabling users to verify they are indeed communicating with one another. Unfortunately, evidence to date suggests users are unable to do this. Accordingly, we study in detail how well users can locate and complete the authentication ceremony when they are aware of the need for authentication. We execute a two-phase study involving 36 pairs of participants, using three popular messaging applications with support for secure messaging functionality: WhatsApp, Viber, and Facebook Messenger. The first phase included instruction about potential threats, while the second phase also included instructions about the importance of the authentication ceremony. We find that, across the three apps, the average success rates of finding and completing the authentication ceremony increases from 14% to 79% from the first to second phase, with second-phase success rates as high as 96% for Viber. However, the time required to find and complete the ceremony is undesirably long from a usability standpoint, and our data is inconclusive on whether users make the connection between this ceremony and the security guarantees it brings. We discuss in detail the success rates, task timings, and user feedback for each application, as well as common mistakes and user grievances. We conclude by exploring user threat models, finding significant gaps in user awareness and understanding. © 2017 by The USENIX Association. All rights reserved.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Optimization of liquid composite molding processes would greatly benefit from an understanding of how voids form and move during processing. While theoretical models exist in the literature for such phenomena, little experimental validation exists due to the difficulties of characterizing voids inside the mold, in a fluid state. The best experimental methodologies presented so far involve light transmission and thus only work for fiberglass reinforcements. An experimental methodology is presented in this paper, in which a proper lighting scheme allows for in situ photography of bubbles during liquid composite molding of carbon reinforcements. The resulting images were processed using image analysis software to identify key parameters such as grey level threshold, and size and circularity limits, which best allow for automated identification of bubbles in the images. No script achieved complete identification of all of the bubbles, but a methodology was developed and implemented to iterate the analysis parameters, evaluate the resulting bubble identification performance, and identify a range of analysis parameters that would provide the best possible results for automated in situ void detection. © 2017 International Committee on Composite Materials.

    <gf:abstract>A Focal L-band Array Feed for the Green Bank Telescope (FLAG) has been in development for the last five years. The system comprises a 19 element, dual polarized hexagonal antenna array, cryogenic front end amplifiers, direct RF to digital over fiber conversion, and broadband, real time digital signal processing. Phased array feeds enable continuous wide field, radio camera imaging on a large reflector. FLAG was mounted in summer 2017 on the GBT in West Virginia, USA as part of commissioning tests. We report on measured receiver figures of merit and experimental results, and comparisons to simulated performance. The measured results indicate that the FLAG instrument achieves unprecedented field of view, sensitivity, and survey efficiency. © Institution of Engineering and Technology.All Rights Reserved.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This paper presents a novel approach to energy scavenging for a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) device to convert the energy stored in pressurized gas into electrical power. The proposed design uses input pressure to move a piston and magnet through a set of coils while pulling on another mass through non-linear springs to open and close the input air valve. The model demonstrates that the design is capable of staying in motion with continual input pressure (up to at least a time stamp of 1 second), and that an average power output of 9.47 µW over 5 ms can be achieved. We suggest that further research be done to optimize the design parameters and that the optimized design be used to the test the system. Copyright © 2019 ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Bacteria with resistance genes are becoming ever more common, and new methods of discovering antibiotics are being developed. One of these new methods involves researchers creating random peptides and testing their antimicrobial activity. Developing antibiotics from these peptides requires understanding which sequence motifs will be toxic to bacteria. To determine if the toxic peptides of a randomly-generated peptide library can be uniquely classified based solely on sequence motifs, we created the PepSeq Pipeline: a new software that utilizes a Random Forest algorithm to extract motifs from a peptide library. We found that this pipeline can accurately classify 56% of the toxic peptides in the peptide library using motifs extracted from the model. Testing on simulated data with less noise, we could classify up to 94% of the toxic peptides. The pipeline extracted significant toxic motifs in every library that was tested, but its ability to classify all toxic peptides depended on the number of motifs in the library. Once extracted, these motifs can be used both to understand the biology behind why certain peptides are toxic and to create novel antibiotics. The code and data used in this analysis can be found at https://github.com/tjense25/pep-seq-pipeline. © 2018 ACM.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Pulse thermography (PT) is a nondestructive testing method in which an energy pulse is applied to a surface while the surface temperature evolution is measured to detect sub surface defects and estimate their depth. This nondestructive test method was developed on the assumption of instantaneous surface heating, but recent work has shown that relatively long pulses can be used to accurately determine defect depth in polymers. This paper examines the impact of varying input pulse length on the accuracy of defect depth quantification as a function of the material properties. Simulations using both thermoplastics and metals show that measurement error is dependent on a nondimensionalized pulse length. The simulation results agree with experimental results for three-dimensional (3D) printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA) components. Analysis and experiments show that defects can be accurately detected with minor modification to the standard methods as long as the pulse ends before the characteristic defect signal is detected. © 2019 by ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>The effects of tool geometry and process parameters on the mechanical properties of friction stir spot welded (FSSW) dissimilar aluminum alloys are experimentally investigated. Two tools with different shoulder profiles, concave and convex, were considered. Two typical automotive aluminum alloys were selected for FSSW, thus resulting in two different material combinations for each shoulder profile. The experimental results showed that the two shoulder profiles caused significant differences in the axial force, the mixing of materials, and the mechanical properties of the joint. The sensitivity of joint strength to the variation of the tool rotation speed and the plunge speed was also quite dependent on the shoulder profile. The experimental result shows that the change of joint strength can be quite significant. © 2017, Korean Society for Precision Engineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>In modern FPGA design, 3rd-party IP is commonly used to reduce costs and time-to-market. However, the complexity of IP and associated CAD tools makes it easier for attackers to maliciously tamper with the IP (i.e. insert Hardware Trojans) in ways that are hard to detect. This work proposes techniques that allows a user to incorporate trusted 3rd-party IP into a design and verify that the incorporation occurs tamper-free. We present comparative results from utilizing this framework across a benchmark suite of 22 designs. We show that the approach reliably detects tampering without giving any false positives. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

The control scheme consists of two parts: a low-level angular rate controller and variable mixer, and a trajectory tracking state-dependent LQR controller. In developing this controller we also present an aerodynamic model of a tilt-rotor with parameters for the Convergence aircraft by E-Flite. Finally we present simulation results for a representative trajectory consisting of vertical takeoff and landing as well as fixed-wing flight. © 2020 AACC.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Infrastructure asset management programs should be focused on managing assets in a way in which the investment for each asset can be optimized producing overall cost savings in both operations and capital budgets. While there is a great amount of evidence of increasing water main breaks and further aging water infrastructure failures an approach looking at each stage of the asset's life cycle is important in reducing costs, allocating resources effectively, and providing a financial condition where the debt ratio can have a margin necessary to issue debt to support water pipe repair and replacement projects. In order to best take into consideration all of the aspects of determining the likelihood of failure as part of the maintenance and capital repair and replacement programs, machine learning can be used as a desktop condition assessment exercise to increase accuracy in predicting the segments of pipe needing additional investment. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This paper investigates the performance of sparse minimum mean squared error (MMSE) equalizer for generalized time-reversed space-time block codes (GTR-STBC) in aeronautical telemetry. GTR-STBC equipped with MMSE equalizer performs the best trade-offbetween the signal-tonoise ratio and inter-symbol interference by allocating unequal power over aeronautical telemetry channels. However, aeronautical telemetry channels are in general consists of larger delay spreads which make the MMSE equalization of aeronautical channels with GTR-STBC computationally complex. Interestingly enough, in spite of larger delays aeronautical channels are made of few sparsely distributed multipaths and therefore their MMSE equalizers are highly compressible. In this paper, compressed sensing based greedy algorithm is used for the design of sparse MMSE equalizer and a convex curve-fitting algorithm is used to find the sub-optimum power allocation parameter at the same sparsity level for GTR-STBC. Our simulation results show that 75-90% of the non-zero equalizer taps can be reduced with a slight relaxation of the mean-squared error (or equivalently slight degradation of bit-error rate performance). It is also observed that the optimum transmitter power profile for the sparse MMSE equalizer is different than that of the non-sparse equalizer.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>A consortium of national and international computing and engineering organizations are currently developing a new set of curricular resources titled Computing Curricula 2020 (CC2020). This project, based on its predecessor CC2005, aims to reflect the state-of-the-art in computing education and practice as well as provide insights into the future of the computing educational field for the 2020s and beyond. This workshop provides an overview of the CC2005 and related reports and links them to the transition into the CC2020 project. It also provides participants with a unique opportunity to collaborate with members of the CC2020 task force and contribute to the development of the resources the project will deliver. The workshop authors and participants will engage in activities to help define how Computing is defined within the project and discuss how to extend its influence in global undergraduate computing education for the future. The authors anticipate full audience involvement and participation in formulating this vision. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>University engineering programs across the USA engage in service learning projects. These projects involve student teams designing and implementing products or solutions for communities in need, often in developing nations. There has been much research done relating to pedagogy and the impact of these programs on student learning. However, less research has been done on measuring the impact of these programs on the affected communities. This paper examines factors that practitioners believe are related to successfully delivering a desirable and transferable solution to affected communities. The authors identified 46 distinct factors from the literature that implicitly or explicitly are suggested to contribute to successful project outcomes. Formed as postulates in this paper, these 46 factors have been separated into 5 categories to assist understanding and implementing these factors into service learning programs. Lastly, different methods of analyzing and measuring project success and impact are discussed. Future methods for proving the viability of the 46 postulates are discussed as well.

        <gf:abstract>This paper proposes a probabilistic extension to flexible hybrid state estimation (FHSE) for cyber-physical systems (CPSs). The main goal of the algorithm is improvement of the system state tracking when realistic communications are taken into account, by optimizing information and communication technology (ICT) usage. These advancements result in: 1) coping with ICT outages and inevitable irregularities (delay, packet drop and bad measurements); 2) determining the optimized state estimation execution frequencies based on expected measurement refresh times. Additionally, information about CPSs is gathered from both the phasor measurement units (PMU) and SCADA-based measurements. This measurement transfer introduces two network observability types, which split the system into observable (White) and unobservable (Grey) areas, based on 1) deployed measuring instruments (MIs) and 2) received measurements. A two-step bad data detection (BDD) method is introduced for ICT irregularities and outages. The proposed algorithm benefits are shown on two IEEE test cases with time-varying load/generation: 14-bus and 300-bus. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The purpose of this research was to identify strategies used and lessons learned by western U.S. commercial construction companies during the great recession (2007-2009). The experience gained by companies who weather an economic downturn must be absorbed into the corporate structure in a meaningful way if that knowledge is to be accessible for future recessions. This study focused on identifying and better understanding the specific approaches that commercial construction companies employed to weather the great recession and the corresponding lessons learned. A stratified purposeful sampling survey was conducted across 15 different commercial construction companies and included 57 participants in various management roles. This paper provides a comprehensive list of 124 different strategies or lessons learned across six principal categories: (1) contracting, (2) risk management, (3) cost-control, (4) human resources, (5) financial, and (6) investment related responses. This paper also provides recommendations for commercial construction companies to consider during various economic cycles on the basis of the lessons learned during this recession and recovery. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Teams of unmanned vehicles are capable of accomplishing a wide variety of mission objectives, such as searching for and tracking targets. In this paper, a receding horizon control is utilized with information based reward measures to accomplish these two competing mission objectives. This approach for cooperatively searching and tracking has proven to be effective in past work. However, it is not generally scalable for large numbers of vehicles due to the computational expense required when generating joint path decisions. This paper proposes a method to dynamically group vehicles with neighbors that have intersecting decision spaces, thus reducing computational cost while still maintaining reasonable performance. Each vehicle also decides its ideal event horizon based upon inferred knowledge of the operational environment, further reducing cost. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>We present a community-led assessment of the solar system investigations achievable with NASA's next-generation space telescope, the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST). WFIRST will provide imaging, spectroscopic, and coronagraphic capabilities from 0.43 to 2.0 _ m and will be a potential contemporary and eventual successor to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Surveys of irregular satellites and minor bodies are where WFIRST will excel with its 0.28 deg2 field-of-view Wide Field Instrument. Potential groundbreaking discoveries from WFIRST could include detection of the first minor bodies orbiting in the inner Oort Cloud, identification of additional Earth Trojan asteroids, and the discovery and characterization of asteroid binary systems similar to Ida/Dactyl. Additional investigations into asteroids, giant planet satellites, Trojan asteroids, Centaurs, Kuiper belt objects, and comets are presented. Previous use of astrophysics assets for solar system science and synergies between WFIRST, Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, JWST, and the proposed Near-Earth Object Camera mission is discussed. We also present the case for implementation of moving target tracking, a feature that will benefit from the heritage of JWST and enable a broader range of solar system observations. © 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>FPGAs provide a promising implementation option for many machine learning applications. Although simulations or software models can be used to explore the design space of these applications, often the final behaviour can not be evaluated until the design is mapped to the FPGA and integrated into the target system. This may be because long run-times are required, or because the environment can not be adequately described using a software model. Once unexpected behaviour is observed, on-chip debug is notoriously difficult; typically a design is instrumented with on-chip trace buffers that record the run-time behaviour for later interrogation. In this paper, we describe instrumentation that can accelerate the process of debugging machine learning applications implemented on an FPGA. Unlike previous work, our instrumentation is optimized to take advantage of characteristics of this application domain. Our instruments gather useful domain-specific information about the observed variables instead of recording the raw values of those elements. Results show that the proposed instruments provide at least 17.8x longer visibility in the most conservative of our experiments at a low area and latency cost. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>As part of a student-educational experience in telemetry, beginning undergraduates build, program, and test small payloads flown in model rockets. These payloads, nicknamed 'femtosats,' collect and transmit real time telemetry on the rocket's performance. The femtosats measure the inertial motions of the model rocket, providing info to extract the flight path. The individually student-designed femtosat circuit board includes a simple inertial measurement sensor that collects acceleration data in the form of x, y, z acceleration vectors which are transmitted in real-time to a radio ground station. The focus of this paper is the collection and analysis of the data from the telemetered inertial measurement sensor and how it can be interpreted and applied in simple model rocket motion analysis. © 2019 International Foundation for Telemetering.

    <gf:abstract>Pulse shapers are widely used in particle detector applications to reduce the rise and fall times of the pulse signal and to remove noise from the frontend amplifiers. We demonstrate a low-noise, low-power pulse shaper employing an active lowpass Salley-Key biquad filter, passive highpass filter, and input/output buffers. The design process is described to generate the desired transfer characteristic while incorporating tuning knobs to adapt the shaper characteristic to the needs of different applications. Utilizing only a single 1.8-V supply, the shaper consumes 1.5 mW and achieves an input-referred noise of 17 µVrms, both the lowest among state-of-the-art. The power efficiency normalized to bandwidth and noise is nearly 1.7_ better than the next best design. © 2020 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This paper presents, for the first time, the process of growing a pattern of carbon nanotubes (CNT(s)) on 316L stainless steel. The data presented is preliminary and requires further investigation to detail the growth behaviors of CNTs on stainless steel in regards to producing a pattern. However, this article presents the viability of producing a pattern on a stainless steel surface that can be used in bio-surfacing and electronic applications, among others. The results show that producing a CNT pattern on stainless steel can be achieved in a similar manner to that of producing a CNT pattern on a silicon wafer, with some vital differences in the photolithography and growth processes. The results also show that long CNT growth can lead to partial overgrowth of the pattern. Copyright © 2018 ASME.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Although tremor is the most common movement disorder, there are few noninvasive treatment options. Creating effective tremor suppression devices requires a knowledge of where tremor originates mechanically (which muscles) and how it propagates through the limb (to which degrees-of-freedom (DOF)). To simulate tremor propagation, we created a simple model of the upper limb, with tremorogenic activity in the 15 major superficial muscles as inputs and tremulous joint displacement in the seven major DOF as outputs. The model approximated the muscle excitation-contraction dynamics, musculoskeletal geometry, and mechanical impedance of the limb. From our simulations, we determined fundamental principles for tremor propagation: (1) The distribution of tremor depends strongly on musculoskeletal dynamics. (2) The spreading of tremor is due to inertial coupling (primarily) and musculoskeletal geometry (secondarily). (3) Tremorogenic activity in a given muscle causes significant tremor in only a small subset of DOF, though these affected DOF may be distant from the muscle. (4) Assuming uniform distribution of tremorogenic activity among muscles, tremor increases proximal-distally, and the contribution from muscles increases proximal-distally. (5) Although adding inertia (e.g., with weighted utensils) is often used to suppress tremor, it is possible to increase tremor by adding inertia to the wrong DOF. (6) Similarly, adding viscoelasticity to the wrong DOF can increase tremor. Based solely on the musculoskeletal system, these principles indicate that tremor treatments targeting muscles should focus first on the distal muscles, and devices targeting DOF should focus first on the distal DOF. © 2019 by ASME.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>FPGAs are being used in data center applications in large quantities. Single-event upsets (SEUs) occur more frequently within large-scale deployments of SRAM-based FPGAs. This work estimates the neutron cross section for SEUs in the configuration memory and memory blocks of a 14-nm FinFET Stratix 10 FPGA. SEU data was collected using a custom SEU data collection system. The developed system takes advantage of SEU mitigation features available on the device. The New York City FIT rate for SEUs is estimated to be 3.2 FIT per Mbit for configuration memory and 7.1 FIT per Mbit for memory blocks. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Earth-observing satellite scatterometers are important instruments capable of measuring a variety of geophysical properties. Historically, the scatterometer design space has revolved around two main architectures: the fan beam and the scanning pencil beam. Since the implementation of these architectures, developments in satellite- relevant technology, spacecraft standards, and engineering practice have expanded the potential design space for Earth-observing scatterometer systems. This expanded design space is investigated and example designs are presented that utilize the expanded design space to improve performance and reduce cost. © 2018 SPIE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Evaluating the social impact indicators of engineered products is crucial to better understanding how products affect individualsÕ lives and discover how to design for positive social impact. Most existing methods for evaluating social impact indicators require direct human interaction with users of a product, such as one-on-one interviews. These interactions produce high-fidelity data that are rich in information but provide only a single snapshot in time of the productÕs impacts and are less frequently collected due to the significant human resources and cost associated with obtaining them. A framework is proposed that describes how low-fidelity data passively obtained using remote sensors, satellites, and digital technology can be collected and correlated with high-fidelity, low-frequency data using machine learning. Using this framework provides an inexpensive way to continuously monitor the social impact indicators of products by augmenting high-fidelity, low-frequency data with low-fidelity, continuously-collected data using machine learning. We illustrate an application of this framework by demonstrating how it can be used to examine the gender-related social impact indicators of water pumps in Uganda. The provided example uses a deep learning model to correlate pump handle movement (measured via an integrated motion unit) with user type (man, woman, or child) of 1,200 hand pump users.

        <gf:abstract>Advanced high strength steels (AHSS) have high susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement, and are often exposed to hydrogen environments in processing. In order to study the embrittlement and recovery of steel, tensile tests were conducted on two different types of AHSS over time after hydrogen charging. Concentration measurements and hydrogen microprinting were carried out at the same time steps to visualize the hydrogen behavior during recovery. The diffusible hydrogen concentration was found to decay exponentially, and empirical relations were found for both types of steel. Hydrogen concentration decay rates were determined to be -0.355 /hr in TBF-980, and -0.225 /hr in DP-980. Hydrogen concentration thresholds for embrittlement were found to be 1.04 mL/100 g for TBF, and 0.87 mL/100 g for DP steel. TBF steel is predicted to recover from embrittlement within 4.2 h, compared to 7.2 h in DP steel. A two-factor method of evaluating recovery from embrittlement, requiring hydrogen concentration threshold and decay rate, is explained for use in predicting recovery after exposure to hydrogen. Anisotropic hydrogen diffusion rates were also observed on the surface of both steels for a short time after charging, as hydrogen left the surface through &lt;001&gt; and &lt;101&gt; grains faster than grains with &lt;111&gt; orientations. This could be explained by differences in surface energies between the different orientations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>FPGAs are being used in large numbers within cloud computing to provide high-performance, low-power alternatives to more traditional computing structures. While FPGAs provide a number of important benefits to cloud computing environments, they are susceptible to radiation-induced soft errors, which can lead to silent data corruption or system instability. Although soft errors within a single FPGA occur infrequently, soft errors in large-scale FPGAs systems can occur at a relatively high rate. This paper investigates the failure rate of several FPGA applications running within an FPGA cloud computing node by performing fault injection experiments to determine the susceptibility of these applications to soft-errors. The results from these experiments suggest that silent data corruption will occur every few hours within a 100,000 node FPGA system and that such a system can only maintain high-levels of reliability for short periods of operation. These results suggest that soft-error detection and mitigation techniques may be needed in large-scale FPGA systems. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Efforts to construct predictive grain boundary (GB) structureÐproperty models have historically relied on property measurements or calculations made on bicrystals. Experimental bicrystals can be difficult or expensive to fabricate, and computational constraints limit atomistic bicrystal simulations to high-symmetry GBs (i.e., those with small enough GB periodicity). Although the use of bicrystal property data to construct GB structureÐproperty models is more direct, in many experimental situations the only type of data available may be measurements of the effective properties of polycrystals. In this work, we investigate the possibility of inferring GB structureÐproperty models from measurements of the homogenized effective properties of polycrystals when the form of the structureÐproperty model is unknown. We present an idealized case study in which GB structureÐproperty models for diffusivity are inferred from noisy simulation results of two-dimensional microstructures, under the assumption that the number of polycrystal measurements available is larger than the number of parameters in the inferred model. We also demonstrate how uncertainty quantification for the inferred structureÐproperty models is easily performed within this framework. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Atomic vapors are a crucial platform for precision metrology but in their simplest implementation, a thermal vapor, the intrinsic optical resonances are broadened due to the random and isotropic thermal motion of the atoms. By structuring the container of a thermal vapor with narrow emission apertures, the velocity distribution can be modified to create a directed beam of atoms.1 These atomic beams can then interact sequentially with a series of optical fields, or interaction zones, and ultimately allow precision control over the internal state of the atom. This is useful for optical frequency standards and precision spectroscopy2, 3 and may also provide the means to build a simple flying qubit platform.4 Furthermore, atomic beams on a chip can be used as a compact, directed source to load magneto-optical traps (MOTs) while minimally increasing the ambient pressure.5 We apply microfabrication techniques to microscopically structure silicon to deterministically control the ow of Rb between connected cavities. We describe a methodology to measure the experimental parameters that govern the flux of atomic vapors in these microfabricated structures with a goal of creating an equivalent electrical circuit model. This toolkit will provide a simple platform for the creation of atomic beams on a chip with controllable pressure profiles and a thorough understanding of the influence of adsorptive effects and pseudo- ballistic trajectories on the resultant atomic beam. © 2020 SPIE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This evidence-based paper describes the transition of a senior-level manufacturing engineering course from a traditional lecture-focused curriculum to a more engaging curriculum based on the research in student-centered learning. Many college courses have a familiar format: students listen to lectures, read textbooks, complete assignments, and demonstrate their learning through exams. Often, the instructor will structure the course for convenience, perhaps creating highly structured PowerPoint presentations and using standardized multiple choice exams to easily grade performance. Students, on the other hand, then structure their learning practices to match - trying to determine exactly how much to come to class, read, and memorize, with the end goal of regurgitating information on the exam and getting a satisfactory grade in the course. These practices are not conducive to long-term retention and application by the students, nor to accurate assessment or facilitation of learning by the instructor. But unless both the instructor and the students in a course understand and are amenable to alternative techniques, the format is unlikely to change. There has been extensive research on techniques aimed to increase student engagement in the classroom, such as "flipping the classroom" and identifying and overcoming the "illusion of learning." This paper describes the efforts of the author over three semesters to incorporate these tools into a senior-level course on manufacturing system design and lean manufacturing to help facilitate better learning and assess proficiency more effectively. Several techniques are used, including suggestions from the recent book Make It Stick by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel. Student feedback and instructor observations are discussed, and future recommendations for the course are given. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Manually identifying mode shapes generated from finite element solvers images is an expensive task. This paper proposes an automated process to identify mode shapes from gray-scale images of compressor blades within a jetengine. This work introduces mode shape identification using principal component analysis (PCA), similar to approaches in facial and other recognition tasks in computer vision. This technique calculates the projected values of potentially linearly correlated values onto P-linearly orthogonal axes, where P is the number of principal axes that define a subset space. Classification was done using support vector machines (SVM). Using the PCA and SVM algorithm, approximately 5300 training images representative of 16 different modes were used to create a classifier. The classifier achieved on average 98% accuracy when tested using a test set of approximately 2000 images given P D 70. The results suggest that using digital images to perform mode shape identification can be achieved with high accuracy. Potential generalization of this method could be applied to other engineering design and analysis applications. © The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2019.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>More than ever before, engineers are creating products for developing countries. One of the purposes of these products is to improve the consumer's quality of life. Currently, there is no established method of measuring the social impact of these types of products. As a result, engineers have used their own metrics to assess their product's impact, if at all. Some of the common metrics used include products sold and revenue, which measure the financial success of a product without recognizing the social successes or failures it might have. In this paper we introduce a potential metric, the Product Impact Metric (PIM), which quantifies the impact a product has on impoverished individuals - especially those living in developing countries. It measures social impact broadly in five dimensions: Health, education, standard of living, employment quality, and security. The PIM is inspired by the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) created by the United Nations Development Programme. The MPI measures how the depth of poverty within a nation changes year after year, and the PIM measures how an individual's quality of life changes after being affected by an engineered product. The Product Impact Metric can be used to predict social impacts (using personas that represent real individuals) or measure social impacts (using specific data from products introduced into the market). © 2017 ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Understanding distortion transfer and generation through fan and compressor blade rows is able to assist in blade design and performance prediction. Using full annulus URANS simulations, the effects of distortion as it passes through the rotor of a transonic fan at five radial locations (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90% span) are analyzed. The inlet distortion profile is a 90-degree sector with a 15% total pressure deficit. Fourier distortion descriptors are used in this study to quantitatively describe distortion transfer and generation. Results are presented and compared for three operating points (near-stall, design, and choke). These results are used to explain the relationship between inlet total pressure distortion, pressure-induced swirl, total pressure distortion transfer, total temperature distortion generation, and circumferential rotor power variation. It is shown that very large changes in pressure-induced swirl and distortion transfer and generation occur between near-stall and design, but only small changes are seen between design and choke. The greatest changes are shown to be near the tip. Local power variations are shown to correlate with total pressure distortion transfer and total temperature distortion generation.

        <gf:abstract>A gas-solid model was developed for a feed system to a pressurized oxy-coal (POC) reactor utilizing the multiphase particle-in-cell (MP-PIC) method. The model was created using CPFD Software's Barracuda Virtual Reactor 17.2.0. The geometry of the feed system was simple and contained a vertical standpipe of five inches feeding into a horizontal pipe of twelve inches. The coal particles from the standpipe were transported into the reactor with gas. To ensure appropriate combustion in the reactor, the feed system needed to maintain both a steady flow rate of gas and solids in the pipe and uniform distribution of solids through the cross-section of the channel. Steadiness was determined by the mass flow rate of the coal leaving the feed system. Uniformity was assessed by plotting gas and particle velocities at the end of the channel. The uniformity and steadiness of the flow was assessed for different grid sizes, starting pressure and boundary conditions, and other parameters within Barracuda.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Mental models are a driving force in the way users interact with systems, and thus have important implications for design. This is especially true for encryption because the cost of mistakes can be disastrous. Nevertheless, until now, mental models of encryption have only been tangentially explored as part of more broadly focused studies. In this work, we present the first directed effort at exploring user perceptions of encryption: both mental models of what encryption is and how it works as well as views on its role in everyday life. We performed 19 semi-structured phone interviews with participants across the United States, using both standard interview techniques and a diagramming exercise where participants visually demonstrated their perception of the encryption process. We identified four mental models of encryption which, though varying in detail and complexity, ultimately reduce to a functional abstraction of restrictive access control and naturally coincide with a model of symmetric encryption. Additionally, we find the impersonal use of encryption to be an important part of participants' models of security, with a widespread belief that encryption is frequently employed by service providers to encrypt data at rest. In contrast, the personal use of encryption is viewed as reserved for illicit or immoral activity, or for the paranoid. © 2018 by The USENIX Association All Rights Reserved.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>A small unmanned aerial vehicle (sUAV) is used with structure from motion (SfM) computer vision (Marr and Nishihara 1978; Snavely et al. 2008) to measure the amount of settlement that is induced by deep dynamic compaction at a site of a new casino near Lake Havasu City, AZ. Details of the project and field operations are provided, and comparisons are made between induced settlement measurements from traditional techniques and induced settlement measurements from the new sUAV/SfM approach. Results of the study show that the sUAV/SfM approach estimates an average induced settlement of 38 cm across the site, which straddles within 2.5 cm of the average induced settlements that were measured with other traditional techniques. Additionally, the sUAV/SfM technique is shown to provide significant detail of the distribution of induced settlements across the site. This distribution of settlements could be indicative of the distribution of subsurface soils that were more affected by the DDC such as looser or cleaner sands. Implications of the findings of this study are briefly discussed. © ASCE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>An experimental methodology to photograph bubbles in-situ during infusion of carbon reinforcements has been developed and demonstrated previously. This method is based on fluorescent photography of bubbles at the surface of the reinforcement during infusion. Previous work with this experimental methodology was done with test oils, but has now been characterized with a curing epoxy resin. The results of in-situ bubble photography at the surface are now compared to standard defect characterization methods including ultrasound and image analysis of polished cross-section micrographs. Such experimental results are meant to provide the data required to build process optimization models capable of prediction of the final void distribution and morphology of voids. © 2019 by Ever J.

        <gf:abstract>The seismic failure of an old quay wall, built in 1932, located in the Port of Iquique during the Mw 8.2 April 1, 2014, Pisagua, Chile, earthquake is studied. A geotechnical exploration, including boreholes, CPT soundings, and surface-based geophysical techniques, was performed to characterize the materials forming the wharf. The data and field observations are then analyzed and used to develop a geotechnical model of two cross-sections modeled in Plaxis2D, to conclude which is the most likely failure mechanism under a dynamic analysis. The results are compared against the deformations measured in a number cross sections of the wharf, suggesting that the failure can be explained by a combined effect of the dynamic increase in lateral earth pressures and the base rotation of the confining walls due to the lack of proper compaction of the rockfill prism below the confining walls. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Human control of a robotic swarm entails selecting a few influential leaders who can steer the collective efficiently and robustly. However, a clear measure of influence with respect to leader position is not adequately studied. Studies with animal systems have shown that leaders who exert strong couplings may be located in front, where they provide energy benefits, or in the middle, where they can be seen by a larger section of the group. In this paper, we systematically vary number of leaders and leader positions in simulated robotic swarms of two different sizes, and assess their effect on steering effectiveness and energy expenditure. In particular, we analyze the effect of placing leaders in the front, middle, and periphery, on the time to converge and lateral acceleration of a swarm of robotic agents as it performs a single turn to reach the desired goal direction. Our results show that swarms with leaders in the middle and periphery take less time to converge than swarms with leaders in the front, while the lateral acceleration between the three placement strategies is not different. We also find that the time to converge towards the goal direction reduces with the increase in percentage of leaders in the swarm, although this value decays slowly beyond the percentage of leaders at 30%. As the swarm size is increased, we find that the leaders in the periphery become less effective in reducing the time to converge. Finally, closer analysis of leader placement and coverage reveals that front leaders within the swarm tend to expand their coverage and move towards the center as the maneuver is performed. Results from this study are expected to inform leader placement strategies towards more effective human swarm interaction systems. © Copyright 2017, International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

        <gf:abstract>Multi-timescale dynamics, from femtoseconds to milliseconds, for irreversible phenomena have been of fundamental importance in understanding mechanisms of chaotic phenomena, electronic bunch evaluation of an accelerator, photoinduced phase transitions, laser ablation, etc. Recently, several groups reported high acquisition rate single-shot methods using chirped-pulse single-shot detections and photonic time-stretching [1-3]. In these works, however, the long fiber with the length of several km was used to temporally stretch the time-encoded spectrum by the group velocity dispersion, but his long distance degrades the signal-to-noise ratio due to propagation losses of the probe pulses through the fiber, thus limiting the observable phenomena. © 2019 IEEE</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Duplication with compare, a circuit-level fault-detection technique, is used in this study in a partial manner to detect radiation-induced failures in a commercial FPGA-based networking system. A novel approach is taken to overcome challenges presented by multiple clock domains, the use of third-party IP, and the collection of error detection signals dispersed throughout the design. Novel fault injection techniques are also used to evaluate critical regions of the target design. Accelerated neutron radiation testing was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the applied technique. One design version was able to detect 45% of all failures with the proposed technique applied to 29% of the circuit components within the design. Another design version was able to detect 31% of all failures with the proposed technique applied to only 8% of circuit components. © 2020 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Though little research has been done in the field of over-design as a product development strategy, an over-design approach can help products avoid the issue of premature obsolescence. This paper compares over-design to redesign as approaches to address the emergence of future requirements. Net present value (NPV) analyses of several real world applications are examined from the perspective of manufacturers (i.e., defense contractors, automobile, pharmaceutical, and microprocessor manufactures) and customers (i.e., purchases of vehicles, televisions, cell phones, washing machines, and buildings). This analysis is used to determine the conditions under which an over-design approach provides a greater benefit than a redesign approach. Over-design is found to have a higher NPV than redesign when future requirements occur soon after the initial release, discount rates are low, initial research, and development cost or price is high, and when the incremental costs of the future requirements are low. © 2019 by ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>A transient gas-solid model based on CPFD SoftwareÕs Barracuda Virtual Reactor was developed for a feed system to a pilot-scale pressurized oxy-coal (POC) reactor. A simplified geometry with a vertical coal hopper feeding into a 0.635-cm diameter horizontal pipe was used to represent key elements of the feed system. Coal particles were transported with 20-atm CO2 gas. The feed system was required to maintain a steady flow of gas and solids at a coal flow rate of approximately 3.8 g/s and a CO2 to coal mass ratio in the range 1-2. Sensitivity of model results to mesh size and particle interaction sub-model settings was assessed. Two design concepts were evaluated. A gravity-fed concept was found to be infeasible due to inadequate coal flow rates even at very high CO2 to coal flow ratios. This was due to gravitational forces being insufficient to move the pressurized coal from the hopper into the CO2 stream at the desired rate. A fluidized bed concept was found to provide the desired coal flow rate and CO2 to coal flow ratio. CO2 injected at the hopper base first fluidized the vertical coal bed before transporting it through a horizontal exit pipe. A second CO2 inlet downstream of the hopper exit pipe was used to dilute the fluidized coal and increase pipe velocities to minimize coal drop out. The amount of coal transported from the hopper was dependent on the net CO2 hopper flow but independent of the CO2 dilution flow. This meant that the coal flow rate and CO2 to coal flow ratio could be controlled independently. Pipe exit coal flow rates were found to fluctuate at levels acceptable for steady burner operation.

        <gf:abstract>An understanding of jet noise source mechanisms can facilitate targeted noise reduction efforts. This understanding has been enhanced with acoustic imaging technologies, such as near-field acoustical holography (NAH). In this study, multisource statistically optimized NAH (M-SONAH) was used to image the sound field near a tethered F-35 aircraft at multiple frequencies. A linear microphone array, placed along the ground, spanned the length of the jet exhaust plume. A multisource model of the sound field was included in the algorithm to incorporate the effects of the ground reflection on the measurement. Narrowband reconstructions elucidated fine details of the radiation patterns, such as multilobe radiation patterns (which may supersede Òdual-lobeÓ patterns shown in previous studies), and broadband shock-associated noise.

    <gf:abstract>An important part of expressing human intent is identifying acceptable tradeoffs among competing performance objectives. We present and evaluate a set of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), that are designed to allow a human to express intent by expressing desirable tradeoffs. The GUIs require an algorithm that identifies the set of Pareto optimal solutions to the multi-objective decision problem, which means that all the solutions are equally good in the sense that there are no other solutions better for every objective. Given the Pareto set, the GUIs provide different ways for a human to express intent by exploring tradeoffs between objectives; once a tradeoff is selected, the solution is chosen. The GUI designs are applied to interactive human-robot path-selection for a robot in an urban environment, but they can be applied to other tradeoff problems. A user study evaluates GUI designs by requiring users to select a tradeoff that satisfies a specified mission intent. Results of the user study suggest that GUIs designed to support an artist's palette-metaphor can be used to express intent without incurring unacceptable levels of human workload. © 2017 ACM.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>In this paper, we investigate the application of physical-layer security coding for next generation aeronautical telemetry communication systems. The coding we refer to is similar to error-control coding, but the codes are deployed for two purposes: to achieve reliable communications, and to achieve secure communications. We consider a single eavesdropper on an air-to-ground aeronautical telemetry link, and show how the overhead measured by the rate of the code can be used to keep secrets from eavesdroppers over noisy channels, rather than recover from channel errors. We show simple examples that work over erasure channels to achieve a security constraint, and then consider approaches to more practical coding constructions for Gaussian channels that satisfies both reliability and security constraints on the network. © held by the author; distribution rights International Foundation for Telemetering.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The potential of compliant mechanisms and related origami-based mechanical systems to store strain energy make them ideal candidates for applications requiring an actuation or deployment process, such as space system arrays, minimally invasive surgical devices and deployable barriers. Many origami structures can be thought of as a compliant mechanism because, like compliant mechanisms, its function is performed through the elastic deformation of its members. This stored strain energy could prove useful. There are opportunities using strain energy to develop approaches to deploy particular mechanical systems. In order to better understand the principles of self-actuation and promote the designs of such systems, a taxonomy of deployable origami mechanisms is presented. This taxonomy demonstrates that there are several different types of deployable origami mechanisms and provides an organizational method to better understand the design space. Characteristics of self deployment in concentrated, deployable origami strain energy mechanisms with internal actuation are identified and examples of strain energy based deployment are provided.

    <gf:abstract>This study was part of a two-year funded grant investigating how to increase student interest and consequent enrollment in construction education. The specifics of this aspect of the study involved a grass-roots movement where construction education was introduced to elementary students (grades 4 - 6). The research model involved giving the students a construction interest inventory and career placement inventory pre-and post-participation in an after-school 3D modeling construction centric curriculum. The curriculum introduced students to the construction fields by giving the students weekly snapshots into construction careers, and also required the students to learn about floor and elevation plans. Students were then taught and expected to design a 3D computer model of a home using Minecraft and Sketchup. The students were provided 4 different models to choose from. The course used a competition based pedagogy where the best home designs were awarded prizes. The results show that student interest after this single intervention (1 semester in length) increased student interest in careers associated to construction. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Helmholtz resonators are widely used, but classical models for the resonators, such as the lumped-element equivalent circuit, are inaccurate for most geometries. This article presents higher-order equivalent circuits for describing the resonators based on the one-dimensional wave equation. Impedance expressions are also derived. These circuits and expressions are given for various constituent resonator components, which may be combined to model resonators with curved, tapered, and straight necks. Resonance frequency predictions using this theory are demonstrated on two realistic resonators. The higher-order predictions are also applied to the theory of side branch attenuators in a duct and the theory of resonator coupling with a mode of an enclosure. © 2019 Institute of Noise Control Engineering.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to revolutionize airspaces across the world. As they increase in prevalence, how UAVs interact with each other and their environments will become increasingly important. The UAV air traffic control system will play an important role in keeping UAV-human interactions safe, effective, and efficient. The large number of automated agents, and the complex interactions between them, make this air traffic control system unusually complex. In this paper, the authors consider how the vertical distribution of UAVs affects an air traffic control systemÕs safety and efficiency. Several possible frameworks are examined, including a free-flight system in which UAVs are allowed to distribute themselves within the entire airspace; a stratified system where different layers are used for travel in different directions, and a compromise system where layers are specified, but vertical course deviation for conflict avoidance is permitted. Investigations are made into how prioritizing some UAVs over others in a hierarchy (for instance, giving emergency services UAVs a separate layer, independent of recreational or commercial users) could affect this system. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

        <gf:abstract>As analysis systems shrink in size to microfluidic scales and devices, there is a need to improve temperature control in the microscale for temperature-sensitive processes. Technology that combines accurate temperature measurement and 3D spatial control of the temperature distribution is limited by common 2D layer-based microfluidic fabrication techniques but can be realized with 3D printed microfluidic chips. This work presents an iterative process to create a microfluidic chip using multimaterial 3D printing to improve temperature sensing and create an even temperature around a target volume. Through an iterative process, verification is presented of fluorophore viability (specifically CdTe quantum dots) after being secured in place by cured PR48 3D printing resin, thus confirming the possibility of fluorescent thermometry as an accurate non-contact temperature sensing method. Numerical analyses of various geometries of chip design iterations are also presented verifying spatially even heating due to the placement of heating sources in the microfluidic chip. Combining the fluorescent thermometry and improved heating will lead to improved temperature control in microfluidic devices. Copyright © 2019 ASME.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>High-performance military aircraft noise contains large- and fine-scale turbulent mixing noise and broadband shock-associated noise. A three-way spectral decomposition quantifies the contribution from each noise type in the sound of a tied-down F-35B aircraft on a linear ground-based array spanning 35Ð152 deg. This large spatial aperture allows for detailed investigation into the spatial variation in broadband shock-associated noise and fine- and large-scale turbulent mixing noise. The spectral models used in the decomposition capture the main features of the measured spectra with three exceptions: 1) that the F-35B engine noise contains multiple spectral peaks in the maximum radiation region, 2) that the nonlinear propagation increases the high-frequency spectral levels, and 3) that the low-frequency levels in the maximum radiation region are less than those predicted by the large-scale similarity spectrum. The F-35B broadband shock-associated noise has the same characteristic shape and variation in peak frequency as overexpanded, laboratory-scale jets. However, the peak level and width exhibit different trends than laboratory-scale broadband shock-associated noise and those recently reported for the F/A-18E aircraft. The strengths and limitations of current models to represent the spatial variation in the spectral content of F-35B noise can guide research efforts to more fully understand the sound radiation.

        <gf:abstract>This work experimentally studies the effects of single wall heating on laminar flow in a high-aspect ratio superhydrophobic microchannel. When water that is saturated with air is used as the working liquid, the non-wetted cavities on the superhydrophobic surfaces act as nucleation sites and allow air to effervesce out of the water and onto the surface when heated. Previous works in the literature have only considered the opposite case where the water is undersaturated and absorbs air out the cavities for a microchannel setting. The microchannel considered in this work consists of a rib/cavity structured superhydrophobic surface and a glass surface separated by spacers. The microchannel is 60 mm long by 14 mm wide and two channel heights of nominally 183 _m and 366 _m are explored. The superhydrophobic side is in contact with a heated aluminum block and a camera is used to visualize the flow through the glass side. Thermocouples are embedded in the aluminum to record the temperature profile along the length of the channel. Temperatures are maintained below the boiling temperature of the working liquid. The friction factor-Reynolds product (fRe) is obtained via pressure drop and volumetric flow-rate measurements. Five surface types/configurations are investigated: smooth hydrophilic, smooth hydrophobic, superhydrophobic with ribs perpendicular to the flow, superhydrophobic with ribs parallel to the flow, and superhydrophobic with ribs parallel to the flow with several breaker ridges perpendicular to the flow. The surface type/configuration has a significant impact on the mass transport dynamics. For surfaces with closed cell micro-structures, large bubbles eventually form and adversely affect fRe and lead to higher temperatures along the channel. When degassed water is used, no bubble nucleation is observed and the air initially trapped in the superhydrophobic cavities is quickly absorbed by the water. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>A nanoporous carbon monolith structure has been developed for use as a scaffold for silicon anodes for lithium batteries. This scaffold was fabricated by coating vertically aligned carbon nanotubes in a highly conformal coating of nanocrystalline carbon, applied via atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition. The coating increases the mechanical stability of the nanotube structure, which provides electrically conductive pathways through the anode. Silicon anodes were fabricated with the monoliths by low pressure chemical vapor infiltration of silicon. This platform allows the carbon and silicon volume fractions to be independently varied in the anode. Anodes with a low silicon content (less than 5% by volume) showed high stability in cycling against lithium with a capacity retention of 89.7% between cycles 2 and 185. Anodes with a high silicon content (_25% by volume) showed poor capacity retention when the carbon content was low (&lt;40% by volume), and transmission electron microscopy analysis indicated that the anodes failed due to the destruction of the nanocrystalline carbon coating during cycling. However, by increasing the carbon content to _60% volume percent in the monolith, capacity retention was substantially stabilized even for anodes with very high silicon loadings. These stabilized electrodes exhibited volumetric capacities as high as _1000 mA h/ml and retained over 725 mA h/ml by cycle 100. © 2017 American Vacuum Society.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The moment magnitude (Mw) 7.1 Anchorage, Alaska, earthquake on November 30, 2018 is one of the largest earthquakes to strike near a major U.S. city since the 1994 Northridge earthquake. No fatalities were reported, but the earthquake caused widespread power outages, structural damage to residential buildings, damage to roadways and railways, and ground failures. This paper presents a summary of preliminary findings by the NSF-sponsored Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) team. Damage was characterized using a combination of on-ground site mapping and aerial reconnaissance with state-of-art geomatics technology and photogrammetry. Recorded peak ground accelerations (PGA) at most stations range between 0.2 g and 0.3 g, with a few sites in the central and southeastern vicinities of Anchorage with PGA greater than 0.5 g. The duration of strong shaking from the M 7.1 event may not have been enough to initiate substantial movements on the majority of the historic landslides from the 1964 M 9.2 earthquake, including the slides at the Turnagain Heights and 4th Avenue. However, liquefaction appeared to have contributed to re-mobilization of the 1964 Potter Hill (Rabbit Creek) landslide. While the majority of the damage observed in Anchorage and surrounding communities appeared to be non-structural, the isolated cases of structural damage seemed to be caused by geotechnical issues, particularly settlement of the foundation and/or slope deformations. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Clustering for data analysis often makes use of external metrics to evaluate how closely clustering assignments match a gold standard. In order to use external clustering metrics, explicit noise points are usually removed or treated as a single cluster. This modification reduces the relevancy of external metrics as a predictor of performance on unlabeled data, where it is not possible to identify noise points. We propose a modification of standard external metrics to explicitly handle noise points in experimental data. We illustrate the effect of this explicit treatment of noise on clustering evaluation using several examples of common noisy clustering problems as well as a real data set from mass spectrometry. We demonstrate that (external) clustering metrics that explicitly treat noise are more robust than standard (external) clustering metrics in the presence of noise. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Thermal transport due to a liquid water jet impinging an isoflux superhydrophobic surface with isotropic slip was modeled analytically. An integral analysis of the transport equations resulting in a system of ordinary differential equations was solved numerically. Impingement on superhydrophobic surfaces greatly reduces the heat transfer that occurs relative to a smooth surface due to gas trapped in cavities on the surface. This results in an apparent slip velocity and temperature jump at the surface. Local and average Nusselt numbers are presented as a function of radial position (0 to 45 jet radii), jet Reynolds number (3_103 to 1.5_104), liquid Prandtl number (2 to 11), normalized slip length (0 to 0.2), and normalized temperature jump length (0 to 0.2). All results are compared to classical (no-slip, no temperature jump) behavior on a smooth surface. Although local Nusselt numbers for the isoflux scenario are greater than the corresponding isothermal case, the difference in Nusselt number between these two heating conditions becomes negligible as the temperature jump length increases to quantities realizable on superhydrophobic surfaces. These results may be utilized to explore heat transfer degradation in applications where smooth surfaces are replaced by superhydrophobic surfaces to avoid fouling. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>To increase the performance and decrease the stress of students in a third-year externally sponsored project experience, second-year industrial design students are introduced to a critical performance skill for the third year experience - clarifying a broad conceptual topic and making it usable for an effective design exploration. The educational goal is for students to gain confidence in their ability to gather insights through interviews, observations, and participatory experiences; simplify this data down to a handful of experience drivers; and use these drivers to create a framework that provides new insight for the more mature design exploration required in the third-year studios. The introduction of this skill earlier than immediately necessary brings tradeoffs. Disconnected from an actual sponsored project, the importance of the skill is not completely evident to the second-year students. However, in course evaluations, students comment that introducing the skill and practicing it earlier than required, helps their initial third-year product studio performance and decrease stress. This paper reports on the introductory project, the simplified process of taking observations and building a driver-based framework, and highlights some of the difficulties and successes in working with students toward this goal.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Recommendation systems are an important part of suggesting items especially in streaming services. For streaming movie services like Netflix, recommendation systems are essential for helping users find new movies to enjoy. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach based on autoencoders to produce a collaborative filtering system which predicts movie ratings for a user based on a large database of ratings from other users. Using the MovieLens dataset, we explore the use of deep learning to predict users' ratings on new movies, thereby enabling movie recommendations. To verify the novelty and accuracy of our deep learning approach, we compare our approach to standard collaborative filtering techniques: k-nearest-neighbor and matrix-factorization. The experimental results show that our recommendation system outperforms a user-based neighborhood baseline both in terms of root mean squared error on predicted ratings and in a survey in which users judge between recommendations from both systems. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This paper introduces a method for enabling multiple small unmannedaircraft to improve navigational accuracy in Global Positioning System (GPS)-denied environments by cooperatively sharing information. The method uses a multilevel framework called relative navigation and visual-inertial odometry: Both of which have been used for singlevehicle GPS-denied navigation. This work modifies the relative navigation architecture by adding the necessary elements to enable decentralized, cooperative operations. The proposed framework also includes the ability to incorporate intervehicle measurements and uses a new concept called the coordinated reset, which is necessary for optimizing the cooperative odometry and improving localization. A simple communication protocol is presented, as well as flight-test results that show its effectiveness. The method is first demonstrated in simulation, including Monte Carlo testing, to show the expected improvement gained from cooperation. Finally, results from hardware testing are presented that show the ability of the system to reject initialization errors, to operate with temporary communications dropouts, and to greatly reduce the total amount of shared data compared to a naive approach. The proposed method is able to improve both global navigation accuracy and the accuracy of the relative aircraft positions for missions that require formation flying. © 2020 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

    <gf:abstract>Identifiability conditions refers to the information required, beyond input-output data, to identify the structure of the system. Since there are different ways to describe a system mathematically, there are different notions of structure associated with a single system. In this work we detail the identifiability conditions of interconnected subsystems, referred to as structured linear fractional transformations. The identifiability conditions of the structured linear fractional transformation are then compared to those of the dynamical structure function, another partial system representation, whose cost for identification was detailed in previous work [1]. Both representations appear to detail the same notions of structure of a system; however, this works demonstrates that the cost of identification of the structured linear fractional transformation is always higher than that of the dynamical structure function. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Evaluating the usability of software across various computing hardware, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, is becoming increasingly important as our need to complete computing tasks on various computing platforms becomes more commonplace in our daily lives. This shift in computing expectations focuses on the ability to compute horizontally, performing the same tasks within different computing environments, as opposed to vertically, performing different tasks in the same computing environment. In this paper, we propose a method by which the usability of a given piece of software can be comparatively analyzed across all hardware platforms on which it is available. This methodology is based on the Majrashi and Hamilton's twelve factors of usability and has been extended to include specific applications and metrics for the following computing platforms: desktop computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones. These metrics focus on collecting quantitative data about the usability of each platform. This quantitative data contrasts with recent studies which focus extensively on qualitative data regarding the user experience. Combining these two types of studies will allow researchers to capture a more comprehensive picture of software usability across computing platforms. The methodology has been validated by performing an initial study using the tasks and performance metrics across each of the defined computing platforms. The results from these initial tests have allowed us to make improvements to the testing methodology as well as some hypotheses for further testing. This proposed methodology, when used in conjunction with qualitative research, can provide a reliable approach for cross-platform usability analysis. Some considerations for educational design of cross platform methodology are discussed. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Logistical and combat operations in riverine, estuarine, and coastal environments remain a key military focus due to limited maneuverability, imperfect knowledge, and rapidly changing constraints. Vessel operation in water environments can be enhanced by routing algorithms that integrate mission parameters with environmental data and vessel specifications. These algorithms must update predetermined routes in a timely manner as parameters and specifications change. The US Army Engineer Research and Development Center Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory is developing the capability for military planners to rapidly optimize vessel routes in water environments by extending capabilities of the Rapid Operational Access and Maneuver Support (ROAMS) modeling platform. The ROAMS platform allows users to rapidly generate models of a water environment in limited-information conditions, utilizing the Adaptive Hydraulics and STeady-state spectral WAVE computational engines for the base two-dimensional hydrodynamics and waves, respectively. Routing capabilities are built on path search and penalty-barrier optimization to automatically produce routes that account for temporally changing environmental variables and vessel maneuverability. This work outlines the components of the ROAMS routing package and presents a case study using ROAMS in a northeastern American metropolitan area. Benefits and limitations of the ROAMS routing platform are discussed and future improvements are suggested. © The Author(s) 2018.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Carbon capture technologies for combustion power plants aim to remove CO2 from flue gas. One such technology is the novel CO2-Binding Organic Liquid (CO2BOL) process developed at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The process utilizes their anhydrous CO2BOL solvent in place of amine mixtures to reduce the energy penalty. A full-scale model of this system based on NETL's Case 10 power plant is projected to produce 7-16% more net electric power over a traditional MEA system for the same plant. These full-scale model predictions are promising, however full-scale simulations are difficult to validate using only bench-scale data. There are errors in both the measurements and models that need to be considered in addition to uncertainties introduced by up-scaling. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a statistical framework used to better understand these uncertainties as well as data gaps in models. By constraining models to data, distributions of model parameters are estimated and then propagated through the model to obtain distributions of key outputs such as carbon capture percent, energy penalty, stripper temperature, etc. The results from this UQ analysis aid the design of experiments (DoE) which identifies data gaps to fill to improve model accuracy. Using UQ and DoE effectively can reduce the development time of new carbon capture by years and save time and money on the path to a pilot, and ultimately full-scale, plant.

        <gf:abstract>High-Level Synthesis (HLS) promises improved designer productivity, but requires a debug ecosystem that allows designers to debug in the context of the original source code. Recent work has presented in-system debug frameworks where instrumentation added to the design collects trace data as the circuit runs, and a software tool that allows the user to replay the execution using the captured data. When searching for the root cause of a bug, the designer may need to modify the instrumentation to collect data from a new part of the design, requiring a lengthy recompile. In this paper, we propose a flexible debug overlay family that provides software-like debug turn-around times for HLS generated circuits. At compile time, the overlay is added to the design and compiled. At debug time, the overlay can be configured many times to implement specific debug scenarios without a recompilation. This paper first outlines a number of ÒcapabilitiesÓ that such an overlay should have, and then describes architectural support for each of these capabilities. The cheapest overlay variant allows selective variable tracing with only a 1.7% increase in area overhead from the baseline debug instrumentation, while the deluxe variant offers 2x-7x improvement in trace buffer memory utilization with conditional buffer freeze support. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>A new method for the calculation of vector acoustic intensity from pressure microphone measurements has been applied to the aeroacoustic source characterization of an unheated, Mach 1.8 laboratory-scale jet. Because of the ability to unwrap the phase of the transfer functions between microphone pairs in the measurement of a radiating, broadband source, physically meaningful near-field intensity vectors are calculated up to the maximum analysis frequency of 32 kHz. The new intensity method is used to obtain a detailed description of the sound energy flow near the jet. The resulting intensity vectors have been used with a ray-tracing technique to identify the dominant source region over a broad range of frequencies. Additional aeroacoustics analyses provide insight into the frequency-dependent characteristics of jet noise radiation, including the nature of the hydrodynamic field and the transition between the principal lobe and sideline radiation. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

        <gf:abstract>We propose a coding methodology for physical layer security with adaptive characteristics, whereby adaptive we mean that the system must be tunable to different operational points/signal-to-noise ratio levels of both the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. Based on interleaving and scrambling as techniques that shuffle the original message before transmission, we consider puncturing over an interleaving/scrambling key and/or over the message as a mechanism to provide the required adaptability to channel conditions. The proposed techniques have shown suitable adaptability to different channel quality levels of the legitimate receiver and eavesdropper, while still guaranteeing the desired reliability for the legitimate receiver and secrecy against the eavesdropper. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>We propose an adaptive secrecy scheme using polar codes with random frozen bits for a general wiretap channel, in which to protect the data from a potential eavesdropper, part or all of the frozen bits are randomly generated per message. To assess the secrecy level of the proposed scheme, three types of decoding strategies are evaluated: a matching decoder which knows the positions of all inserted bits inside the blocklength and tries to estimate them using the same decoding techniques, a blind decoder which treats all the frozen bits as the same value, and a random decoder which considers those dynamic bits as random at the receiver. Results are presented in terms of the system security gap, assuming an adaptive decoding strategy. It is shown that the system achieves combined secrecy and reliability. The proposed scheme does not assume knowledge of the eavesdropper's channel when defining the indices of information and frozen bits. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Efficient heat transfer is critical in the design and optimization of thermal control systems. Static radiative heat exchangers are often simple and reliable systems but typically cannot be adapted to environmental changes. Adaptable radiative heat exchangers can be adjusted in response to variations in the thermal environment or operating conditions and have the potential for increased efficiency and reduced cost. Dynamic control of a radiative heat exchanger is possible through geometric manipulation of a segmented, self-irradiating fin, consisting of rigid panels that are linked by thermal hinges in an accordion arrangement. In this paper, a numerical model is described to predict the temperature profile and efficiency of a radiative heat exchanger, accounting for conduction and self-irradiation. Governing equations are cast in terms of the conduction-radiation interaction parameter, surface emissivity, actuation angle, and the thermal conductance of the hinges linking the panels. Results indicate that a turn-down ratio (largest possible heat rate divided by smallest possible heat rate) of greater than three is possible for realistic panel geometries and materials. Self-irradiation decreases the turn-down ratio, and there is evidence that an optimal number of rigid panels exists for any combination of panel geometry and device temperature. The maximum efficiency occurs when the plates are in the collapsed position, but the heat rate is at a minimum in this configuration. Finally, the properties and geometry of the plates are shown to have a more significant effect on the turn-down ratio than the properties of the thermal hinges. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This paper investigates the performance of sparse minimum mean squared error (MMSE) equalizer for generalized time-reversed space-time block codes (GTR-STBC) in aeronautical telemetry. GTR-STBC equipped with MMSE equalizer performs the best trade-offbetween the signal-tonoise ratio and inter-symbol interference by allocating unequal power over aeronautical telemetry channels. However, aeronautical telemetry channels are in general consists of larger delay spreads which make the MMSE equalization of aeronautical channels with GTR-STBC computationally complex. Interestingly enough, in spite of larger delays aeronautical channels are made of few sparsely distributed multipaths and therefore their MMSE equalizers are highly compressible. In this paper, compressed sensing based greedy algorithm is used for the design of sparse MMSE equalizer and a convex curve-fitting algorithm is used to find the sub-optimum power allocation parameter at the same sparsity level for GTR-STBC. Our simulation results show that 75-90% of the non-zero equalizer taps can be reduced with a slight relaxation of the mean-squared error (or equivalently slight degradation of bit-error rate performance). It is also observed that the optimum transmitter power profile for the sparse MMSE equalizer is different than that of the non-sparse equalizer.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Modern secure communication systems typically follow a pattern at the transmitter of first compression encoding followed by encryption, and then additional encoders to mitigate the effects of channel noise, etc. One of the purposes of the compression algorithm is to remove statistical information about the plaintext, so as to render the ciphertext impervious to statistical attacks. It is well known, however, that in practice there is no such thing as a universal compression algorithm; thus, some statistical information about the plaintext tends to survive the compression process. In this paper, we consider Lempel-Ziv Welch compression and analyze its effectiveness in removing statistical information from English plaintext. Specifically, we present several techniques for exploiting the structure of the compression algorithm to launch a successful statistical attack on compressed and encrypted data. All attacks are ciphertext only, and one of them relies on linear programming. Although our attacks indicate that an eavesdropper may require additional ciphertext to carry out a successful attack if compression is used, the specific adaptive nature of the Lempel-Ziv compression technique leaves its own statistics on the message, which can be exploited by an attacker. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The Coanda effect is the phenomenon in which a jet entering quiescent fluid attaches to a nearby solid object due to inhibited entrainment of ambient fluid near the solid. Little is known about the influence of the Coanda effect on wildland fire behavior. Specifically, there is a lack of knowledge regarding how the flame attachment on slopes influences firefighter safety zone considerations in rugged terrain. This paper presents results for small-scale n-heptane pool fire experiments near a slope, showing how flame shape and heat flux are influenced by slope angle, slope boundary condition and distance from flame base. Flames near slopes leaned toward the slope, and at some slope angles the flames attached to the slope. The average angle at which the effects of slope were noticeable was between 10¡ and 45¡, depending on the criteria used. No difference was observed between a bare slope and an insulated slope. Dimensional analysis showed that important characteristics of flame attachment on slopes in the small-scale experiments were in the range estimated for the large fires. The implication is that the traditional view of safe separation distance as being the distance from the flame base is inadequate for fires near slopes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The symmetric information rate is used to define the relationship between the APSK constellation parameters, the code rate, and the average and peak Eb=N0. Minimizing the average Eb=N0 reproduces the DVB-S2 constellation parameters for 16- And 32-APSK. Minimizing the peak Eb=N0 produces DVB-S2 constellation parameters for 16- And 32-APSK that minimize the peak-to-average power ratio. The peak-to-average power ratio gains are less than 1 dB, but when used on coded systems with very steep decoded bit error probability vs. Eb=N0 curves, the gains can be significant. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>In this Paper, we present a complete, proof-of-concept sense-and-avoid solution for small unmanned aircraft systems, including a small low-cost ground-based radar system, multitarget tracking and estimation, collision detection, and an avoidance planner. We describe the development of a small frequency-modulated continuous-wave phased-array radar system that provides a three-dimensional surveillance volume. The radar measurements are processed using the recursive random sample consensus algorithm, producing tracks for the intruders and the ownship. We propose a collision-detection algorithm based on the geometric relationship between encountering aircraft. If a collision threat is detected, a collision-free new path is generated for the ownship using a two-step path-planning algorithm. In the first step, an initial suboptimal path is generated using an A search. In the second step, the path is refined using a variant of the potential fields technique, adapted to the sense-and-avoid scenario. The performance of the complete system is demonstrated with flight-test experiments. © 2018 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.. All rights reserved.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamic networks are described by their dynamical structure function, and generally they have many possible state space realizations. This work characterizes the necessary and sufficient conditions on a state transformation that preserves the dynamical structure function, thereby generating the entire set of realizations of a given order for a specific dynamic network. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Although energy-based methods have advantages over the Newtonian methods for kinetostatic modeling, the geometric nonlinearities inherent in deflections of compliant mechanisms preclude most of the energy-based theorems. Castigliano's first theorem and the Crotti-Engesser theorem, which don't require the problem being solved to be linear, are selected to construct the energy-based kinetostatic modeling framework for compliant mechanisms in this work. Utilization of these two theorems requires explicitly formulating the strain energy in terms of deflections and the complementary strain energy in terms of loads, which are derived based on the beam constraint model. The kinetostatic modeling of two compliant mechanisms are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of using Castigliano's first theorem and the Crotti-Engesser theorem with the explicit formulations in this framework. Future work will be focused on incorporating use of the principle of minimum strain energy and the principle of minimum complementary strain energy. Copyright © 2017 ASME.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Stopping origami in arbitrary fold states can present a challenge for origami-based design. In this paper two categories of kirigami-based models are presented for stopping the fold motion of individual creases using deployable hard stops. These models are transcrease (across a crease) and deploy from a flat sheet. The first category is planar and has behavior similar to a four-bar linkage. The second category is spherical and behaves like a degree-4 origami vertex. These models are based on the zero-thickness assumption of paper and can be applied to origami patterns made from thin materials, limiting the motion of the base origami pattern through self-interference within the original facets. Model parameters are based on a desired fold or dihedral angle, as well as facet dimensions. Examples show model benefits and limitations. Copyright © 2019 ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Hospital providers often use workarounds to circumvent processes so that patients can receive care. Workarounds in response to operational failures enable care to continue and therefore may be indicative of workers' commitment. On the other hand, workarounds in the absence of operational failures may signal an ineffective approach associated with lower quality of care and worse patient outcomes. Working closely with healthcare providers, we developed a survey to measure workaround behaviors and operational failures on medical/surgical units. The lead author surveyed over 4,000 nurses from 63 hospitals throughout the United States. We matched this data with audit data on the incidence of pressure injuries among over 21,000 patients on 262 nursing units in 56 survey hospitals. Hospital-acquired pressure injuries are a significant risk to patient health and hospital costs. We do not find support for our hypothesis that workarounds are associated with a higher rate of hospital-acquired pressure injuries. However, when we take into account the moderating role of operational failures on the relationship between workarounds and pressure injuries, we find significant results. When nursing units have lower levels of operational failures, workarounds are associated with higher rates of hospital-acquired pressure injuries. Our results provide evidence that workarounds may be associated with negative patient outcomes, if they stem from a process-avoiding approach. The best results can be achieved by reducing both operational failures and workarounds via instilling a process-focused approach. © 2019 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>In order for students graduating with construction-related undergraduate degrees to provide immediate and effective benefit to their employers, program curricula must accurately reflect the needs of the industry. One area of the typical construction management curriculum that receives a varying level of emphasis and consideration amongst accredited programs is Mechanical Systems. Similarly, the wide range of possible topics and concepts relevant to mechanical systems receive varying levels of attention. The purpose of this research was to identify what mechanical system topics and concepts were perceived by industry partners as being most important for graduating construction students to know. Construction industry professionals were surveyed to determine what topics they believed warranted prioritization in mechanical system courses. Results indicate that topics related to Contract Administration (e.g., plan and specification reading, MEP coordination, submittal review, etc.) and How HVAC Systems Work (e.g., differences between HVAC system types, HVAC equipment, etc.) were comparatively the most important topics for students to have a knowledge of. Instructors of mechanical systems classes should use these findings to determine what major subject areas to focus on, and allocate time to the various specific concepts appropriately within the constraints of their individual program. © 2018, © 2018 Associated Schools of Construction.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>While current state-of-the-art recommendation systems perform fairly well, they generally do better at recommending the popular subset of all products available rather than matching consumers with the vast amount of niche products in what has been termed the "Long Tail". In their seminal work, "Challenging the Long Tail Recommendation", Yin et al. make an eloquent argument that the long tail is where organizations can create the most value for their consumers. They also argue that existing recommender systems operate fundamentally different for long tail products than for mainstream goods. While matrix factorization, nearest-neighbors, and clustering work well for the "head" market, the long tail is better represented by a graph; specifically a bipartite graph that connects a set of users to a set of goods. In this paper, we show the algorithms presented by Yin et al., as well as a set of similar algorithms proposed by Shang et al., which traverse the bipartite graphs through a random walker in order to identify similar users and products. We build on elements from each work, as well as elements from a Markov process, to facilitate the random walker's traversal of the graph into the long tail regions. This method specifically constructs paths into regions of the long tail that are favorable to users. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Tremor is the most common movement deficit and manifests in a variety of disorders, including Essential Tremor, Parkinson's Disease, Dystonia, and Cerebellar Ataxia. Although medication and surgical interventions have significantly reduced patient suffering, they are only partially effective and can carry undesired side effects, leaving many patients without satisfactory treatment options. Wearable tremor-suppressing devices could provide an alternative to medication and surgery. Multiple research groups have developed orthotic prototypes to low-pass filter tremor, but these devices have not yet been optimized for in-vivo use. Optimizing non-invasive tremor suppression requires an understanding of where the tremor originates mechanically (which muscles) and how it propagates to the hand (where it matters most). Here we present on the beginnings of our multi-pronged work to determine the origin, propagation, and distribution of Essential Tremor, and we provide preliminary results. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>ODT (one-dimensional turbulence) simulations of particle-carrier gas interactions are performed in the jet flow configuration. Particles with different diameters are injected onto the centerline of a turbulent air jet. The particles are passive and do not impact the fluid phase. Their radial dispersion and axial velocities are obtained as functions of axial position. The time and length scales of the jet are varied through control of the jet exit velocity and nozzle diameter. Dispersion data at long times of flight for the nozzle diameter (7Êmm), particle diameters (60 and 90Êµm), and Reynolds numbers (10, 000Ð30, 000) are analyzed to obtain the Lagrangian particle dispersivity. Flow statistics of the ODT particle model are compared to experimental measurements. It is shown that the particle tracking method is capable of yielding Lagrangian prediction of the dispersive transport of particles in a round jet. In this paper, three particle-eddy interaction models (Type-I, -C, and -IC) are presented to examine the details of particle dispersion and particle-eddy interaction in jet flow. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Task parallel programming models such as Habanero Java help developers write idiomatic parallel programs and avoid common errors. Data race freedom is a desirable property for task parallel programs but is difficult to prove because every possible execution of the program must be considered. A partial order over events of an observed program execution induces an equivalence class of executions that the program may also produce. The Does-not-Commute (DC) relation is an efficiently computable partial order used for data race detection. As a relatively weak partial order, the DC relation can represent relatively large equivalence classes of program executions. However, some of these executions may be infeasible, thus leading to false data race reports. The contribution of this paper is a mechanized proof that the DC relation is actually sound for commonly used task parallel programming models. Sound means that the first data race identified by the DC relation is guaranteed to be a real data race. A prototype analysis in the Java Pathfinder model checker shows that the DC relation can significantly reduce the number of explored states required to prove data race freedom in Habanero Java programs. In this application, the search for data race using the DC relation is both sound and complete. © 2019 FMCAD Inc.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This paper presents a case study in engineering for global development. It introduces the Village Drill, which is an engineered product that has - 5 years after its introduction to the market - enabled hundreds of thousands of people across 15 countries and three continents to have access to clean water. The Village Drill creates a 15 cm (6 in) borehole as deep as 76 m (250 ft) to reach groundwater suitable for drinking. The case study presents facts for the actual development and sustaining and are unaltered for the purpose of publication. This approach provides the reader with a realistic view of the development time, testing conditions, fundraising, and the work needed to sustain the drill through 5 years of sales and distribution. The purpose of the case study is to provide sufficient and frank data about a real project so as to promote discussion, critique, and other evaluations that will lead to new developments that inspire and inform successful engineering for global development. As part of the case, the paper describes six fundamental items: the product, the customer, the impact, the manufacturing, the delivery, and the revenue model of the drill.

        <gf:abstract>This paper presents a pseudo-static modeling methodology for dynamic analysis of distributed compliant mechanisms to provide accurate and efficient solutions. First, a dynamic stiffness matrix of the flexible beam is deduced, which has the same definition and a similar form as the traditional static compliance/stiffness matrix but is frequency dependent. Second, the pseudo-static modeling procedure for the dynamic analysis is implemented in a statics-similar way based on D'alembert's principle. Then, all the kinematic, static and dynamic performances of compliant mechanisms can be analyzed based on the pseudo-static model. The superiority of the proposed method is that when it is used for the dynamic modeling of compliant mechanisms, the traditional dynamic modeling procedures, such as calculation of the elastic and kinetic energies as well as using Lagrange's equation, are avoided and the dynamic modeling is converted to a staticssimilar problem. Comparison of the proposed method with an elastic-beam-based model in previous literature and finite element analysis for an exemplary XY precision positioning stage reveals its high accuracy and easy operation. © 2018 by ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This paper presents a technique for active topology inference in store, code, and forward networks. Many techniques exist for topology inference and are well suited for storeand- forward and cut-through switching; however, these simpler techniques fail to capitalize on the flexibility of recoding afforded by store, code, and forward networks. This is in contrast to network coding, which recodes the data whenever possible and consequently achieves the maximum flow (and minimum cut) of throughput across a network. The technique herein utilizes a single probe message between a single source and potentially many destination nodes to achieve deterministic topology inference. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>While determining modes in a rectangular cavity is a straightforward analytical exercise, fully understanding the behavior of the fields in a large over-moded cavity whose walls are lined with antennas, such as the reconfigurable over-the-air chamber, is a more complicated undertaking. This paper uses the Moment Method to analyze such a chamber, where each wall is lined with 9 monopole antennas. The evaluation of the cavity Green's function used in the numerical computation is accelerated through the use of Ewald's method. A comparison of scattering parameters between monopoles on the walls obtained both by the Moment Method analysis and experimental measurements shows that the technique is highly accurate in predicting the chamber field behavior. © 2018 Institution of Engineering and Technology.All Rights Reserved.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Constructing embankments over soft soils can be problematic due to the magnitude and time associated with subsurface compression. Determining the end of primary consolidation is greatly exacerbated for layered soils that compress at varying rates. This paper discusses the use of magnet extensometer instrumentation to isolate compression within specific subsurface layers and associated techniques for estimating the time of construction induced settlement. Field data is used during construction to estimate the end of construction induced subsurface compression, which greatly affects the project schedule. This case study briefly summarizes instrumentation installation, data gathering, and the challenges associated with projecting the time of construction settlement. Two different curve fitting techniques were evaluated in this research: using standard primary consolidation equations and finite difference equations for estimating the end of primary consolidation settlement. For the site investigated, the curve fitting techniques proved to be somewhat problematic because the soil layers had small magnitudes of settlement and the transition between primary and secondary settlement was not readily apparent during the evaluation of real time field data. Using the finite difference equations also proved somewhat problematic trying to fit the full record of field data based on all of the different stages of loading. Additional lessons learned include the need for effective project communication between contractors, designers, and owners and a corresponding open discussion regarding practical settlement risk. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

    <gf:abstract>This study analyzes the feasibility of placing modified exercise equipment in public places to enable human energy harnessing. By assessing the impacts as a system-level synthesis of economic, environmental, productivity, and health benefits, it is shown that introducing human-powered equipment (HPE) in public places would be feasible and beneficial both to society in general and to the specific stakeholders investing in this technology. This study develops a framework to evaluate applications of this technology using benefits to costs analyses. The benefits and challenges for successful implementation of HPE technology are also presented and evaluated in various case studies involving public places at airports and schools.

        <gf:abstract>Protective layers on aluminum mirror surfaces which can be removed via the use of atomic hydrogen or hydrogen plasmas at the point of use in space may allow an expansion of broad-band mirrors into the EUV. LUVOIR (large, UV-optical-IR telescope) is a potential NASA flagship space-based observatory of the 2020's or 30's. It would utilize the largest mirrors ever flown1. Their reflective coating will almost certainly be aluminum, since such telescopes would profit from truly broad-band mirrors. To achieve reflectance over the broadest band, the top surface of such aluminum mirrors, however, needs to be bare, without the oxide layers that naturally form in air. This will open the 11 to 15 eV band. Since thin aluminum films are largely transparent between 15 and 70 eV an EUV mirror under the aluminum could make EUV bands such as 30.4 nm available for space-based astrophysics without sacrificing mirror IR, visible and UV reflectance. The local space environment for the observatory is sufficiently oxygen-free that the surface should remain bare for decades. We discuss protecting as-deposited aluminum mirrors with robust, oxygenimpenetrable, barrier layers applied in vacuo to the aluminum immediately after deposition and before air contact. The goal is that the barrier could also be cleanly, and relatively easily, removed once the mirror is in space. We propose hydrogen atoms as the means for removing the overcoat, since they can be expected to meet the criteria that the means is gentle enough to not roughen the mirror surface, and does not redeposit material on the mirror or other spacecraft components. We have investigated both organic and inorganic (such as, a-Si) hydrogen-removable films that can be applied to the aluminum immediately after its deposition have been investigated. We also examined the REVAP technique, using Cd and Zn. Agglomeration limited their effectiveness as barrier layers. That and dealing with the reevaporated atoms may limit their utility as barrier materials. © COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Electric aircraft face a steep tradeoff between the demand for runway performance and range. While fuel based propulsion technologies typically increase in specific power with increasing size, electric propulsion is typically much more scalable. This system scalability enables alternative designs including distributed propulsion, optionally powered propulsion units, and vectored thrust, which can all contribute to better runway performance and range. In this paper, we explore how continuously powered distributed propulsion can reduce takeoff distance while still satisfying range constraints. We use a combination of a blade element momentum method, a vortex lattice method, experimental data, and nonlinear optimization techniques to model and explore the design space. We have found that for this conceptual design study, a fully blown wing with propellers at the optimal diameter for the load (8 propellers for a 300 km range constraint) can reduce the takeoff distance by over 80% when compared to the optimal 2 propeller case using the same models. There is over a 2x increase in the wing lift coefficient which leads to a 36% reduction in liftoff speed. Also, the optimal fully blown case produced 2.9 more thrust during takeoff with only an 11% increase in total aircraft mass. Using propeller tip speed as a surrogate for noise, we found that the propeller tip speed decreased takeoff performance in an exponential manner: the tip speed could be decreased from Mach 0.8 to Mach 0.5 with only a 2x increase in takeoff rolling distance while decreasing the constraint to Mach 0.3 produced an 8x increase. © 2018, (publisher Name).

        <gf:abstract>This paper presents a large-scale Project-Based Learning (PBL) curriculum that can handle 200 students per year without requiring an undue commitment of faculty or teaching-assistant time. The following strategies were used to attain the student benefits of the PBL curriculum while accommodating a large number of students and while keeping the faculty and teaching-assistant commitments to reasonable levels. (1) A top-level hardware/software specification of the system (laser-tag) is provided to the students. (2) Students must test their software and hardware using both their own methods and with provided test software and hardware fixtures. (3) How-to and demonstration videos are provided via a dedicated youTube channel. (4) Students implement the system by completing a series of scheduled milestones. (5) The same PBL project is completed every year. This large scale PBL curriculum is conducted during the junior year and has been in place for several years in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>A major limitation in industrial welding is the undesirable microstructures that form due to high peak temperatures and cooling rates. In particular, martensite and other brittle microstructures often form in steels during rotary friction welding (FW). In order to address this, cooling rate and temperature control is developed for FW. Limits of achievable FW cooling rates are primarily determined by thermal and geometric properties such as thermal diffusivity and length. A controller limits interface temperatures during a weld preheat, changing the thermal profile and slowing post-weld cooling. This method is demonstrated in 1045 steel. Cooling simulations, TTT diagrams, microhardness line scans, and scanning electron microscopy are used for analysis. Without temperature and cooling rate control, martensite readily forms after a weld. With temperature and cooling rate control, martensitic transformations are completely avoided and a pearlitic microstructure is developed. Temperature and cooling rate control is a viable tool in designing post-weld microstructures within achievable cooling rate limitations. © 2019</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>For fan/compressor design, quantifying distortion transfer and generation bladerow by bladerow through a fan/compressor is important to understand the flow physics and predict performance. What is needed are descriptors capable of describing distortion profiles with both high and low distortion content and account for the reshaping of distortion profiles. Four key parameters were identified as desirable to quantitatively capture distortion transfer, generation and effects on performance: distortion magnitude, shape, severity and phase. A set of distortion descriptors based on Fourier analysis are shown to quantitatively capture distortion magnitude, shape and phase change across bladerows. These Fourier descriptors are modal amplitude, total amplitude, and phase shift. When used together, these Fourier descriptors can be used to qualitatively describe any conceivable profile shape for any parameter. Copyright © 2017 ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Engineers are increasingly required to work in teams that span time zones and cultures. Engineering education has begun to attempt to prepare students for this environment. An important topic is how to best form teams of students for distributed design projects. The goals of this research were to validate a method for organizing teams to maximize team performance and identify and validate metrics for individuals that would help in the organization of distributed teams of student engineers. A review of previous, related research is provided. A description of the proposed method of team organization is given, along with methods of data collection and a comparison of the proposed method to common methods. How students were divided into teams and each team's method of organizing sub-teams are described. Use of online surveys, tests, statistical methods, and other data gathering and analysis methods are explained. Statistical analysis of survey results and qualitative results of interviews and observations suggest that a profile-based method for organizing teams results in significantly higher team satisfaction. Some methods for measuring and/or predicting individual attributes related to teamwork, such as the significance of participation in team sports, were validated. No correlation was found between which university a student attended and a student's level of satisfaction with his or her team. Team success in distributed, multi-disciplinary student design teams can be improved by gathering information about team members and using a profile-based method to organize team members into sub-teams and leadership positions. © 2018 TEMPUS Publications.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Exploring the system-level interactions between vehicle exhaust criteria pollutants, human health, and natural weather patterns such as inversion events is increasingly expedient given the accelerated growth and concentration of human populations in recent years. Pollutants often accumulate to unhealthy concentrations during winter inversion events like those that commonly occur in the state of Utah and other mountainous regions. Electric vehicles (EV) are a potential solution to reduce harmful tail-pipe emissions that accumulate during inversions. This work represents a systems-level analysis of the degree to which replacing internal combustion engine vehicles (ICE) with EVs would reduce the near-road accumulation of criteria pollutants. The analysis draws on vehicle miles travelled data from major highways in Utah, vehicle fuel efficiency data, EPA-specified vehicle pollution emission standards, and local weather pattern trends. It employs two models, built in MATLAB and the agent-based modeling environment NetLogo, to determine pollutant concentrations, accumulation, and dispersion rates. These results are processed to determine changes in the Air Quality Index (AQI) caused by adjusting the percentage of EVs present within the vehicle population. The analysis concludes that replacing a significant percentage (80-100%) of the existing, fossil-fuel powered vehicle population with EVs would improve local AQI by 13 points. During extreme inversion events in Utah, these reductions would delay AQI levels from reaching 'red,' or unhealthy, status for enough time to allow local weather patterns to shift and dissipate the inversion event and accompanying pollution. Such a drastic reduction in AQI translates into better adolescent and elderly health and could minimize the risk of early onset asthma and other respiratory illnesses in regions negatively affected by high traffic pollution and winter inversion events. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>To investigate changes of ultrafast dynamics during irreversible phase change in phase change materials Ge2Sb2Te5, we performed high-repetition-rate singleshot pump-probe spectroscopy using a combination of time-encoding and timestretching methods. By measuring the pump-probe traces while ramping the pump intensity, we observed a clear change in the ultrafast pump-probe dynamics after the phase change. Correlation between the ultrafast dynamics in the femtosecond timescale and the amount of phase change observed in millisecond timescale indicates that accumulation of the excited states in the sample plays an important role in the acceleration of the phase change. The result clearly demonstrates the usefulness of our method, which could be applied to the investigation of multi-timescale dynamics in various irreversible phenomena. Improved signal-to-noise ratio and the variable time-window of the single-shot pumpprobe measurements were also demonstrated using a grating pair and a chirped fiber Bragg grating. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

        <gf:abstract>The dynamic cone penetration test (DPT) developed in China has been correlated with liquefaction resistance in gravelly soils based on field performance data from the Mw7.9 Wenchuan earthquake. The DPT consists of a 74 mm diameter cone tip driven by a 120 kg hammer with a free fall height of 100 cm. To expand the data base, DPT soundings were performed at the Pence Ranch and Larter Ranch sites where gravelly soil liquefied during the 1983 Mw6.9 Borah Peak earthquake. DPT testing was performed using an automatic hammer with the energy specified in the Chinese standard and with an SPT hammer. Comparisons suggest that standard energy corrections developed for the SPT can be used for the DPT. In general, the DPT correctly predicted liquefaction and non-liquefaction at these two test sites. Liquefaction resistance from the DPT also correlated reasonably well with that from Becker penetration testing (BPT). © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Mechanical advantage is traditionally defined for single-input and single-output rigidbody mechanisms. A generalized approach for identifying single-output mechanical advantage for a multiple-input compliant mechanism, such as many origami-based mechanisms, would prove useful in predicting complex mechanism behavior. While origamibased mechanisms are capable of offering unique solutions to engineering problems, the design process of such mechanisms is complicated by the interaction of motion and forces. This paper presents a model of the mechanical advantage for multi-input compliant mechanisms and explores how modifying the parameters of a model affects their behavior. The model is used to predict the force-deflection behavior of an origami-based mechanism (Oriceps) and is verified with experimental data from magnetic actuation of the mechanism. © 2018 by ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>The present preliminary numerical study investigates a lifted methane/air jet flame in a vitiated coflow by means of the map-based, stochastic One-Dimensional Turbulence (ODT) model. In the considered configuration, a jet flame issues from a central nozzle into a vitiated coflow of hot combustion products from an array of lean H2/air flames. Centreline profiles for mixture fraction, temperature and mass fraction of O2 and OH obtained from ODT simulations with a planar and cylindrical formulation are shown and compared to measurements from Cabra et al. (2005). Additionally, two-dimensional renderings of the jet flame and scatter plots of temperature versus mixture fraction and OH mass fraction versus mixture fraction are provided. Although the application of ODT for reactive flows in jet configurations is not novel, the chosen lifted jet flame in a vitiated coflow represents a challenge for the model. The accurate representation of the subtle interactions of the hot coflow products with the cold unburnt jet flow are crucial for the reaction and autoignition of the jet (Cabra et al., 2005). Considering the reduced order of the model and the taken assumptions, the achieved results reasonably match with the measurement data. © 2019 International Symposium on Turbulence and Shear Flow Phenomena, TSFP.

        <gf:abstract>There is a large collection of masonry models due to the highly complex and heterogeneous nature of masonry as a structural material. While the individual masonry components can be considered isotropic at the material level, masonry assemblages are anisotropic at the structural level. These properties of masonry make it difficult to develop models that accurately describe the material behavior for all analysis and design scenarios. One analysis tool that is efficient and reliable is the use of stress fields. Stress fields are based on the lower-bound theorem of the theory of plasticity. Stress fields have been combined with the truss analogy to produce what is known as the strut-and-tie modelling procedure. This article presents ongoing research that has the objective to develop strut-and-tie modelling procedures for masonry. The presented methodology uses the existing strut-and-tie guidelines for reinforced concrete as starting point and applies that methodology to the modelling of several masonry shear walls with openings. The shear strength predictions from the proposed strut-and-tie modelling methodology are shown to perform well compared to the experimental strengths. This is associated with the ability of the strut-and-tie modelling procedure to account for the geometric particularities of each wall. © 2018 The International Masonry Society (IMS).</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Photophoresis can stably hold opaque microscopic particles in a laser focus surrounded by room air with strength sufficient to enable centimeter-scale patterns to be drawn by sweeping the laser beam. The resulting images rely on visual persistence as laser light scatters from the particle, which is rapidly swept through the 3-D pattern. Control can be maintained while moving the particle with air speeds up to 2 m/s. A desire to greatly increase the sweep speed motivates a re-examination of the fundamentals of photophoresis-based laser-particle traps. Most explanations offered are qualitative, with differing opinions as to whether, for example, asymmetric heating or asymmetric thermal accommodation is primarily at work. Which particles become trapped in the beam is typically based on self-selection, as a variety of particles with possible differing shapes and sizes are offered to the laser focus for capture. Characteristics that make some particles preferred over others are especially relevant. There is broad consensus that structure in the laser focus greatly aids in stable trapping. Nevertheless, it is still possible for even a relatively smooth TEM00 beam to capture and hold particles. Moreover, even in a structured focus (i.e. with aberrations and local intensity minima and maxima), questions remain as to exactly how a particle becomes stably trapped in certain beam locations.

        <gf:abstract>The paper describes a global identification procedure for dynamic power system models in the form of differential and algebraic equations. Power system models have a number of features that makes their improvement challenging - they are multi-level, multi-user and multi-physics. Not surprisingly, they are nonlinear and time varying, both in terms of states (memory variables) and parameters, and discrete structures, such as graphs, are strongly blended with continuous dynamics, resulting in network dynamics. The transient stability models are used as a prototypical example. Our method is based on information geometry, and uses advances in computational differential geometry to characterize high-dimensional manifolds in the space of measurements. In the case of network parameters, a comparison is presented with circuit-theoretic techniques. The results are illustrated on the case of IEEE 14-bus test system with 58 parameters in our realization. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Compliant joints have a number of advantages that make them suitable for highly constrained design problems. While much work has been done on the design of compliant joints manufactured from planar sheet materials, this work focuses on the design of cylindrically-curved joints. A method for using lamina emergent torsional (LET) joints to increase energy storage efficiency in curved sheet materials is presented. A numerical model is provided for predicting the stiffness and maximum applied moment of a curved LET joint. Predicted curved LET joint stiffnesses and maximum moments are utilized to create shape factors that produce an effective modulus of elasticity and an effective modulus of resilience. For a given case, the effective modulus of elasticity is shown to decrease by about three orders of magnitude while the effective resilience decreases by approximately one order of magnitude. Designers can use this information to tailor materials to fit design requirements or to select alternative materials that were previously unsuited for an application. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Magnesium AZ31B sheets of 2, mm thickness were stretch formed using a 101.6, mm diameter punch at room temperature and subsequent increments from 25 to 125, ¡C. Surface strains were measured using a digital image correlation method in order to ensure that biaxial stretching was achieved. The punch height versus load curve was found to be the same for temperatures of 25 and for 50, ¡C, while at 75, ¡C the load for a given punch height was less. This difference seems to indicate a change in deformation mechanism between 50 and 75, ¡C. Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) was used to quantify features of the microstructure in the as-received and the strained specimens. Rather than a sudden transition from twinning to slip at low temperatures, it appears that twinning gradually decreases and slip activity increases as temperatures rise across the range from 25 to 125, ¡C. This confirms recent predictions found in the literature. The twin activity predominantly involves the formation of compression twins which rapidly transform further to create secondary twins for easier strain accommodation. © 2017, The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Spacecraft with large arrays sometimes have deployed sizes that are much larger than the launch volumes; in this case, deployable arrays are used. Several methods exist for stowing, deploying, and stiffening large space arrays. Often these functions are performed by separate systems. This work presents a novel array system that integrates these functions into one system, without the need for external deployment or stiffening structures. The integration comes from the combination of the kinematics of origami-based folding approaches, stored strain energy of compliant hinges, and tension cables. Additionally, due to the origami-based folding approach used, tunable deployed shapes and retraction are possible using reeled cables. The result is a new array architecture that is self-deployable, self-stiffening, and retractable (SDSR) and is described in this work. To understand the behavior of such systems, this work presents the modeling and testing of an SDSR array using an origami flasher pattern and discusses the results for the performance considerations of deployment motion, deployment stiffness, and dynamics. © 2020 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

        <gf:abstract>This paper considers the application where a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) must determine the bearing to another UAV already in flight in an environment where GPS is denied through malicious jamming. The development therefore presents the design of a compact and low-power circuit architecture for radio frequency direction finding. The system uses switches to sequentially connect the elements of a circular array antenna to the receive circuitry. While simple architecturally, this causes phase differences between estimates that must be calibrated through use of a reference receive channel. A MUSIC-based bearing estimator developed on a small on-board processor shows the ability to accurately estimate the azimuth and elevation angles to the remote UAV during experimental flight tests. © Institution of Engineering and Technology.All Rights Reserved.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors can be multiplexed in large numbers to monitor the performance of large structures. This paper addresses the collection of FBG reflection spectra from wavelength division multiplexed sensors at fast acquisition rates. The spectral and temporal resolution is first derived as a function of the tunable filter and measurement system properties. The method is applied to impact loading investigations of a stiffened composite skin panel. The reflected spectrum of each FBG in an array, embedded in the panel, is collected at 100 kHz during the impact events with a spectral resolution down to 40 pm. Visualization of the FBG responses to these impact events, including the presence of spectral distortion in some FBG spectra, is presented. Future analyses based on the full-spectral data sets can enable the assessment of the localized progression of internal damage in such structures. © 2001-2012 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>A competition for teams of three students using a prototype multi-user computer-aided design (MUCAD) tool was held to investigate various hypotheses regarding the performance of teams in such a setting. By comparing models from the competition to the same model in a single-user CAD environment, it is seen that use of a MUCAD system can significantly increase the value-added per unit of calendar time for a modeling effort. An investigation was also made into the causes of the performance differences among the various MUCAD teams which participated in the competition. Analysis of the results shows that teams that encouraged effective forms of communication and teams whose members scored similarly on the Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Visualization of Rotations (PSVT:R) performed better than other teams. Areas of future research in analyzing teams in MUCAD environments are suggested. Copyright © 2017 by ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>K-mers form the backbone of many bioinformatic algorithms. They are, however, difficult to store and use efficiently because the number of k-mers increases exponentially as k increases. Many algorithms exist for compressed storage of kmers but suffer from slow insert times or are probabilistic resulting in false-positive k-mers. Furthermore, k-mer libraries usually specialize in associating specific values with k-mers such as a color in colored de Bruijn Graphs or k-mer count. We present kcollections1, a compressed and parallel data structure designed for k-mers generated from whole, assembled genomes. Kcollections is available for C++ and provides set-and maplike structures as well as a k-mer counting data structure all of which utilize parallel operations designed using a MapReduce paradigm. Additionally, we provide basic Python bindings for rapid prototyping. Kcollections makes developing bioinformatic algorithms simpler by abstracting away the tedious task of storing k-mers.1https://www.github.com/masakistan/kcollections © 2020 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>A key element of system transparency is allowing humans to calibrate their trust in a system, given the implicit inherent uncertainty, emergent behaviors, etc. As robotic swarms progress towards real-world missions, such transparency becomes increasingly necessary in order to reduce the disuse, misuse and errors humans make when influencing and directing the swarm. However,achieving this objective requires addressing the complex challenges associated with providing transparency. Two swarm transparency challenge categories, with exemplar challenges, are provided. © 2018 Authors.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>We demonstrate a hybrid "package-less" polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-FR4 system for contact imaging. The system embeds the CMOS image sensor directly in a PDMS layer instead of the standard chip package to support microfluidic structures much larger and more complex than those in prior art. The CMOS/PDMS layer is self-aligned to form a continuous, flat surface to provide structural support for upper microfluidic layers. The system consists of five layers of PDMS implementing fluid channels, valves, chambers, and inlets/outlets. A custom CMOS image sensor with integrated signal conditioning circuits directly captures light from sample fluid for high optical collection efficiency. Owing to the flexibility afforded by the integration process, the system demonstrates, for the first time, integrated valves in contact imaging. Moreover, we present the first direct comparison of the optical performance of a CMOS image sensor and a photomultiplier tube (PMT) in identical contact-imaging conditions. Measurements show that our CMOS sensor achieves 17 dB better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with a commercial PMT across a broad range of integration times, with a maximum SNR of 47 dB. Chemiluminescent testing successfully shows signal detection for different analyte concentrations and integration times. The contact-imaging system demonstrates a detection limit of 25 _M of a 9,10-diphenylanthracene-based solution. © 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>There are several design equations available for calculating the torsional compliance and the maximum torsion stress of a rectangular cross-section beam, but most depend on the relative magnitude of the two dimensions of the cross-section (i.e., the thickness and the width). After reviewing the available equations, two thickness-to-width ratio independent equations that are symmetric with respect to the two dimensions are obtained for evaluating the maximum torsion stress of rectangular cross-section beams. Based on the resulting equations, outside lamina emergent torsional joints are analyzed and some useful design insights are obtained. These equations, together with the previous work on symmetric equations for calculating torsional compliance, provide a convenient and effective way for designing and optimizing torsional beams in compliant mechanisms. © 2018, The Author(s).</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe the use of a test artifact proposed by NIST to quantify the dimensional accuracy of a metal additive manufacturing process. Insights from this paper are given concerning both the performance of the machine, a concept laser Mlab cusing machine, and the applicability of the NIST test artifact in characterizing accuracy. Recommendations are given for improving the artifact and standardizing a process for evaluating dimensional accuracy across the additive manufacturing industry. Design/methodology/approach: Three builds of the NIST additive manufacturing test artifact were fabricated in 316 stainless steel on a concept laser Mlab cusing machine. The paper follows the procedure described by NIST for characterizing dimensional accuracy of the additive process. Features including pins, holes and staircase flats of various sizes were measured using an optical measurement system, a touch probe and a profilometer. Findings: This paper describes the accuracy of printed featuresÕ size and position on the test artifact, as well as surface finish on flat and inclined surfaces. Trends in variation of these dimensions are identified, along with possible root causes and remedies. This paper also describes several strengths and weaknesses in the design of the test artifact and the proposed measurement strategy, with recommendations on how to improve and standardize the process. Originality/value: This paper reviews a previously proposed design and process for measuring the capabilities of additive manufacturing processes. It also suggests improvements that can be incorporated into future designs and standardized across the industry. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>We describe a method for simultaneously identifying and reducing dynamic power systems models in the form of differential-algebraic equations. Often, these models are large and complex, containing more parameters than can be identified from the available system measurements. We demonstrate our method on transient stability models, using the IEEE 14-bus test system. Our approach uses techniques of information geometry to remove unidentifiable parameters from the model. We examine the case of a networked system with 58 parameters using full observations throughout the network. We show that greater reduction can be achieved when only partial observations are available, Including reduction of the network itself. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Installing the many sensors required for flight testing is currently a difficult and awkward process requiring significant wiring. Short term sensor installation could be greatly improved if individual sensors did not have to be connected to a distant power source. This paper proposes that small aerodynamic vibration energy harvesting devices could provide power directly to sensors and simplify installation. To investigate feasibility, the simplest known energy harvester configuration is chosen. A mathematical model to represent the device is then developed. A test scenario using the aerodynamic vibrations present on the F-15B aircraft is then incorporated into the model. The test results are analyzed to determine if the energy harvesting device can produce sufficient energy to justify further analysis. Finally, potential design improvements are discussed. © held by the author; distribution rights International Foundation for Telemetering.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Oxy-fired coal combustion is a promising potential carbon capture technology. Predictive CFD simulations are valuable tools in evaluating and deploying oxy-fuel and other carbon capture technologies either as retrofit technologies or for new construction. However, accurate predictive simulations require physically realistic submodels with low computational requirements. In particular, comprehensive char oxidation and gasification models have been developed that describe multiple reaction and diffusion processes. This work extends a comprehensive char conversion code (CCK), which treats surface oxidation and gasification reactions as well as the processes such as film diffusion, pore diffusion, ash encapsulation, and annealing. In this work several submodels in the CCK code were updated with more realistic physics or otherwise extended to function in oxycoal conditions. Improved submodels include the annealing model, the swelling model, the mode of burning parameter, and the kinetic model, as well as the addition of the Chemical Percolation Devolatilization (CPD) model. Results of the char combustion model are compared to oxy-coal data, and further compared to parallel data sets near conventional conditions. © 2017 Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute.

        <gf:abstract>A major dilemma faced in the nuclear industry is repair of stainless steel reactor components that have been exposed to neutron irradiation. When conventional fusion welding is used for repair, intergranular cracks develop in the heat-affected zone (HAZ). Friction stir processing (FSP), which operates at much lower peak temperatures than fusion welding, was studied as a crack repair method for irradiated 304L stainless steel. A numerical simulation of the FSP process in 304L was developed to predict temperatures and recrystallized grain size in the stir zone. The model employed an Eulerian finite element approach, where flow stresses for a large range of strain rates and temperatures inherent in FSP were used as input. Temperature predictions in three locations near the stir zone were accurate to within 4%, while prediction of welding power was accurate to within 5% of experimental measurements. The predicted recrystallized grain sizes ranged from 7.6 to 10.6 _m, while the experimentally measured grains sizes in the same locations ranged from 6.0 to 7.6 _m. The maximum error in predicted recrystallized grain size was about 39%, but the associated stir zone hardness from the predicted grain sizes was only different from the experiment by about 10%. © 2019</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This paper introduces notions of abstraction and realization for dynamic networks. These processes generate dynamically equivalent representations of a system, but with varying degrees of structural detail. Nuanced definitions and associated conditions for maintaining well-posedness for these multi-resolution representations of a dynamic system are then detailed, ensuring that hierarchies of network representations are sensible as multi-resolution models of dynamic networks. Although the ideas are developed precisely here for LTI networks, many of the concepts remain fundamental in the nonlinear setting. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The merits of machine learning in information security have primarily focused on bolstering defenses. However, machine learning (ML) techniques are not reserved for organizations with deep pockets and massive data repositories; the democratization of ML has lead to a rise in the number of security teams using ML to support offensive operations. The research presented here will explore two models that our team has used to solve a single offensive task, detecting a sandbox. Using process list data gathered with phishing emails, we will demonstrate the use of Decision Trees and Artificial Neural Networks to successfully classify sandboxes, thereby avoiding unsafe execution. This paper aims to give unique insight into how a real offensive team is using machine learning to support offensive operations. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This paper reports the results of a survey of 1,976 individuals regarding their opinions on TLS inspection, a controversial technique that can be used for both benevolent and malicious purposes. Responses indicate that participants hold nuanced opinions on security and privacy trade-offs, with most recognizing legitimate uses for the practice, but also concerned about threats from hackers or government surveillance. There is strong support for notification and consent when a system is intercepting their encrypted traffic, although this support varies depending on the situation. A significant concern about malicious uses of TLS inspection is identity theft, and many would react negatively and some would change their behavior if they discovered inspection occurring without their knowledge. We also find that a small but significant number of participants are jaded by the current state of affairs and have lost any expectation of privacy. © 2016 by The USENIX Association All Rights Reserved.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The Zipper Tube Reinforcement (ZTR) is a novel support system developed to mitigate buckling in thin flexible devices used in robotic surgery. The ZTR was inspired by a construction technique called a Buckling Restrained Braced Frame (BRBF) and deployable booms for space applications. It utilizes a zipper function to allow a rolled sheet to deploy into a variable-length tube and stow in a small volume spooled on a mandrel. The tube envelops the device and allows it to support a much higher compressive load before buckling failure through the insertion stroke. The ZTR also enables the possibility of smaller, more flexible devices due to its design for continuous support and could find application in other fields. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Unmanned vehicles are capable of working as teams to accomplish a wide variety of mission objectives, such as searching for and tracking targets. In this paper, vehicle search paths are dictated by a joint cost function which maximizes the reward earned from partitioned sections across the search area. In previous work, these rewards were assigned based on the elapsed time since the section had last been searched. This approach is effective in rewarding vehicles to search out areas which haven't been visited in a long time, yet it lacks the ability to weight grid cells differently based on the probability that targets will be in that section. This paper proposes a method of using accumulated knowledge of the average density of targets within an area, along with a Gaussian process regression to assign rewards. Vehicles then choose paths that are more likely to find targets rather than seeking areas which have not been searched recently. Through numerical simulations we show that this method increases the number of targets seen by cooperating UAVs and provides an accurate estimate of target density within a search area. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Little is known about the impact self-efficacy and topic emotions have on novice engineering students when first exposed to an engineering design course. Freshman students may have difficulties regulating their emotions when exposed to new or complex topics such as engineering design. Consequently, they may become frustrated or discouraged as the semester progresses that can lead to feelings of hopelessness and anxiety. In contrast, novice students may experience feelings of hope and interest that may foster positive learning outcomes in engineering design. The authors explored freshmen engineering studentsÕ (n = 58) levels of self-efficacy and topic emotions while participating on a freshmen-level engineering and graphics design course. Our findings suggests that while positive and negative topic emotions are inversely related, both seem to be associated with self-efficacy. Further, topic emotions appear to mediate self-efficacy as topic emotions such as curiosity, happiness, and interest were reported by engineering students during engineering design activities. Self-efficacy increased over the course of the semester for these freshman engineering design students. © 2019 TEMPUS Publications.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Superhydrophobic surfaces have been shown to reduce drag in single-phase channel flow; however, little work has been done to characterize their drag-reducing ability found in two-phase flows. Adiabatic, air-water mixtures were used to explore the influence of hydrophobicity on two-phase flows and the hydrodynamics which might be present in flow condensation environments. Pressure drop measurements in a rectangular channel with one superhydrophobic wall (cross-section approximately 0.37 _ 10 mm) and three transparent hydrophilic walls were obtained. Data for air/water mixtures with superficial Reynolds numbers ranging from 22Ð215 and 55Ð220, respectively, were obtained for superhydrophobic surfaces with three different cavity fractions. Agreement between experimentally obtained two-phase pressure drop data and correlations in the literature for conventional smooth control surfaces was better than 20 percent, which is within the accuracy of the correlations. The data reveal a reduction in the pressure drop for two-phase flow in a channel with a single superhydrophobic wall compared to a control scenario. The observed reduction is approximately 10 percent greater than the reduction that is observed for single-phase flow (relative to a classical channel). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Flow simulation for liquid composite molding is often performed to assist in process optimization and requires the permeability of the reinforcement to be characterized. For infusion under a flexible membrane, such as vacuum infusion, or for simulation of a part with non-uniform thickness, one must test the permeability at various levels of compaction. This process is time consuming and often relies on interpolation or extrapolation around a few experimental permeability measurements. To accelerate the process of permeability characterization, a small number of methodologies have been previously presented in the literature, in which the permeability may be tested at multiple fiber volume contents in a single test. Some of the methods even measure the permeability over a continuous range of thicknesses, thus requiring no later interpolation of permeability values. A novel method is presented here for the rapid measurement of permeability over a continuous range of fiber volume content, in a single unidirectional vacuum infusion flow experiment. The thickness gradient across the vacuum bag, as well as the fluid pressure at several locations in the mold were concurrently measured to calculate the fabric compressibility. An analytical flow model, which accounts for the compressibility, is then used by iterating the fitting constant in a permeability model until the predicted flow front progression matches empirical measurement. The method is demonstrated here for two reinforcement materials: (1) a fiberglass unbalanced weave and (2) a carbon biax non-crimped fabric. The standard deviation across the multiple experiments for each material and flow orientation ranged from 12.8% to 29.7%. Validation of these results was performed by comparing the resulting permeability with multiple non-continuous permeability measurement methods. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has become the most widely used method for chemically analyzing surfaces. In XPS, photoelectrons are generated by irradiating a surface with x rays. As the importance and popularity of XPS have grown, it has drawn users without significant XPS experience, and incorrect and incomplete interpretations of XPS spectra regularly appear in the literature. This tutorial is designed as a tool to guide less experienced users in analyzing XPS survey spectra. Here, the authors examine a series of XPS survey spectra collected during the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 from trimethylaluminum and water precursors. Prior to this, brief explanations of XPS and ALD are presented. This tutorial is structured as a series of questions and answers that the interested reader may choose to engage in. The XPS spectra are scrutinized to extract information about the elements present in the film, the presence of contamination, and the nature of the film growth process. The questions and answers in this tutorial address important fundamental issues common to the interpretation of many XPS survey spectra in the context of ALD. © 2018 Author(s).</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The water industry has seen many types of academic surveys and studies on water main replacement programs and the benefits of asset management and prioritization. However, many utilities have not historically tracked all of the elements of water main break data. One factor used to quantify the occurrences of failing underground pipe networks is water main break rates. Water main break rates are calculated for all pipe materials used in water delivery to create a measurement to judge pipe performance and durability. Water main break rates can vary year to year and by utility. However, in aggregate, break rates produce a compelling story which can aid our prudent decision making as it relates to repairing and replacing our underground pipes. In April 2012, Utah State University published an initial comprehensive survey of water utilities. This was a survey of water main breaks and operating characteristics at utilities located in U.S. and Canada. Six years later in 2018, a new water main break study was released reviewing the national metric for citizens served per one mile of pipe, aggregate data on pipe material break rates, the analysis of age and corrosion in failure modes, and related observations on pressure, delivery volumes, effects of soil corrosivity, and trenchless technology practices. This paper reviews the newest water main break study metrics and findings and outlines various trends and projections of water main breaks in the U.S. and Canada which can be used to benchmark an organization's water main breaks and use this critical data in asset management plans. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>According to the Canadian Science Publishing, there are approximately 2.5 million scientific papers published each year. The huge volume of publications can be contributed to a substantial increase in the total number of academic journals, including the increasing number of predatory or fake scientific journals, which yield high volumes of poor-quality research work. The effect of this scenario is that there is an obsolete jungle of journals to flip through in searching for high-quality and relevant references for researchers, ranging from the ones who simply look for citations to cite or latest development and knowledge in a specific scientific area of study. Querying existing web search engines and research paper archived websites is not the solution to the problem, since they are m-equipped to suggest high quality publications to meet the users' information needs. In solving this problem, we propose an elegant research paper recommender, which is unique compared with existing ones, since besides considering the topics and contents of related publications, it also examines the authority and popularity of each publication to ensure its quality. Conducted empirical study shows that our recommender outperforms existing research paper recommenders and contributes to the design of searching relevant publications. © 2020 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Sites with known occurrences of mud pumping or other track concerns were investigated to determine the prevalence of concrete bottom tie abrasion and environmental and track conditions that could contribute to its occurrence. Field investigations showed that it occurs in diverse geographic locations around the U.S. and is a source of continued maintenance concern for railroads. Water appeared to be a significant factor involved in concrete bottom tie abrasion. Ballast fouling, center-binding cracking, rail surface profile variations, and large track movement during loading was seen in locations with concrete bottom tie abrasion. Bumps or track stiffness changes were often found at locations of abrasion damage. Specifically, some locations with known stiff track conditions exhibited significant abrasion damage.

    <gf:abstract>The focus of this study is the influence of voids on the damage behaviour in quasi-static loading of resin-infused carbon fibre-reinforced polymers. Experimental results are presented for quasi-static loading in combination with high-resolution tomographic imaging and statistical analysis (homology of pores or voids and induced cracks). Three distinct mechanisms were observed to control delamination growth in the presence of sharp and blunt voids. Delamination cracks interact with the supporting yarns, especially in combination with air pockets trapped in the resin in the form of long, sharp voids. This resulted in crack growth that coalesces with delamination cracks from neighbouring yarn-voids during increased out-of-plane loadÐdisplacement, with almost no presence of intralaminar transverse cracks. This highlights the benefits and drawbacks of the supporting yarn during out-of-plane loading. © The Author(s) 2019.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>A correct understanding of passive force-deflection response is important for lateral load evaluations of bridges during extreme events such as earthquakes and during in-service conditions resulting from thermal expansion and contraction of the superstructure. The goal of this study was to better understand this behavior for abutments backfilled with both gravel and geosynthetic reinforced soil (GRS). Large-scale testing was performed with non-skewed and 30¡ skewed abutment configurations. Two tests were performed at each skew angle, one with gravel backfill and one with GRS backfill. The test abutment backwall was 3.35 m wide, non-skewed, and 1.68 m high and loaded laterally into the backfill. Both backfills exhibited greater passive resistance than sand backfills owing to increased internal friction angle and unit weight. Skew angle reduced the passive force in both cases by about 40%. The GRS backfills had reduced initial stiffness and only reached 79% to 87% of the passive force developed by the unreinforced gravel backfill. This reduction was considered to be a result of reduced interface friction at the geotextile-backwall interface due to wrapping. Reduced stiffness may be favorable for abutment configurations because it allows thermal movement without developing excessive induced stresses in the bridge superstructure. © ASCE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>One of the most critical decisions made by transportation project stakeholders is the choice of a project delivery method for their project. Delivery methods have been shown to significantly impact project cost and schedule. As the use of alternative project delivery methods increases, the perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages to using a particular method have matured. This paper reports on a national study of over 80 transportation owners and designers to measure their perceptions of the three most widely used delivery methods: design bid build (DBB), construction manager at risk (CMAR), and design build (DB). The study develops a list of factors that influence the selection of a delivery method, and then tests the most significant factors that lead to the selection of each individual method. Analyses using Fisher's least significant difference intervals and multiple range tests allow for the identification of specific correlations between the delivery method and motivating factors or project goals. The analyses show that delivery method selection is motivated primarily by project urgency, cost, and risk allocation. For the three main delivery methods of DBB, CMAR, and DB, motivation for their selection is primarily based on cost, risk allocation, and project urgency, respectively. User perceptions align with findings from literature in terms of schedule performance, but do not align in terms of cost performance. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by reporting on the most current motivating factors for the selection and use of the most popular delivery methods. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Experiential learning opportunities give students the ability to understand the implications of principles and theories learned in the classroom through lived experiences. This article examines the use of a construction project simulation activity to teach project management principles in an undergraduate construction management course. After a description of the experiential learning theory and relevant literature examining experiential learning simulations in education, it provides an overview of the methods used to create the experience of small-scale design-bidbuild project simulation in a project management course. Around 240 undergraduates students at the junior or senior level participated as designated contractual players in the project and went through the project from inception to completion over the course of 5 weeks. Finally, it offers a brief discussion of the implications of the findings for construction management and engineering education. Specifically, it discusses that simulated projects possess the potential to provide unique learning opportunities particularly, designed experiences triggering different emotions within the structures of the traditional classroom. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Bandwidth efficient linear modulations require a pulse shape with finite support in the time domain while simultaneously achieving good spectral containment in the frequency domain. The squareroot Nyquist pulse achieves zero intersymbol interference (ISI) at its matched-filter output but does so with infinite support in the time domain. This paper investigates three different methods for generating an FIR approximation of a square-root Nyquist pulse.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>A hierarchical Bayesian statistical before-after model was used to analyze locations where raised medians have been installed. Twenty locations where raised medians were installed in Utah from 2002 to 2014 were used in this analysis. A model was developed that analyzed raised medians by access category (AC). Only three AC were represented in the data. Regression plots depicting a decrease in crashes before and after installation and crash modification factor (CMF) plots presenting the CMF values estimated for different vehicle miles traveled values were created as output from the before-after model. Overall, installing a raised median gives an approximate average reduction of 53 percent for all crashes. Individual AC analysis yielded results ranging from 32 to 44 percent reduction for all severity groups except severity 4 and 5. When the model was only run for crash severity 4 and 5, a larger reduction of 57 to 58 percent was found. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>An outstanding challenge in nonlinear systems theory is identification or learning of a given nonlinear system's Koopman operator directly from data or models. Advances in extended dynamic mode decomposition approaches and machine learning methods have enabled data-driven discovery of Koopman operators, for both continuous and discrete-time systems. Since Koopman operators are often infinite-dimensional, they are approximated in practice using finite-dimensional systems. The fidelity and convergence of a given finite-dimensional Koopman approximation is a subject of ongoing research. In this paper we introduce a class of Koopman observable functions that confer an approximate closure property on their corresponding finite-dimensional approximations of the Koopman operator. We derive error bounds for the fidelity of this class of observable functions, as well as identify two key learning parameters which can be used to tune performance. We illustrate our approach on two classical nonlinear system models: the Van Der Pol oscillator and the bistable toggle switch. © 2018 AACC.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Current operational fire spread models are mostly based on experimental results from dead, low moisture fuel beds and thus do not perform well when modeling fire behavior in live shrubs. A previously-developed semi-empirical shrub combustion model was improved and expanded to treat live chamise and big sagebrush. Fire spread in live chamise and big sagebrush shrubs was measured in an open-roofed wind tunnel, which was used as the basis to develop the current model. Shrub geometry was modeled by coupling a Lindenmayer-systems (L-systems) approach with terrestrial LiDAR scan data. Wind speed was held constant at 1.4 m/s. Species specific correlations for physical properties and combustion characteristics of individual fuel element were incorporate in this model. Modeling results compared well with measured time-dependent fire behavior. Variations in local fuel density affected flame spread more than the overall fuel bed density. This model is an innovative approach to simulate shrub combustion via flame propagation at individual fuel element scale with a fairly low computational cost. © 2017 Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute.

    <gf:abstract>Origami-based mechanisms can provide useful capabilities in folding large structures to stow in small volumes. However, when using monolithic thick-sheet materials for these types of mechanisms, accommodating the thickness proves challenging. One approach to solve this is to create compliant mechanisms along the fold lines that inherently store energy when actuated and causes the mechanism to tend toward its low energy state. This tendency can be used to create bistable states. We outline a method to use this stored energy to achieve bistable states and name the resulting mechanism an origami-based "Thickness-accommodating bistable interior vertex" (TABIV) in monolithic thick-sheet materials. The kinematics and energy-displacement relationships of this mechanism are derived. Prototypes are shown to exhibit the predicted bistable behavior and the mechanism is integrated and prototyped into origami-based mechanisms demonstrating advantageous multi-stable behaviors. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>While there is great interest in 3D printing for microfluidic device fabrication, the challenge has been to achieve feature sizes that are in the truly microfluidic regime (&lt;100 _m). The fundamental problem is that commercial tools and materials, which excel in many other application areas, have not been developed to address the unique needs of microfluidic device fabrication. Consequently, we have created our own stereolithographic 3D printer and materials that are specifically tailored to meet these needs. We review our recent work and show that flow channels as small as 18 _m x 20 _m can be reliably fabricated, as well as compact active elements such as valves and pumps. With these capabilities, we demonstrate highly integrated 3D printed microfluidic devices that measure only a few millimeters on a side, and that integrate separate chip-to-world interfaces through high density interconnects (up to 88 interconnects per square mm) that are directly 3D printed as part of a device chip. These advances open the door to 3D printing as a replacement for expensive cleanroom fabrication processes, with the additional advantage of fast (30 minute), parallel fabrication of many devices in a single print run due to their small size. © 2019 SPIE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>More than half of international construction projects are underperforming. Poorly defined scope of work has been ranked as the one of the highest reasons for poor performance over which owners and construction stakeholders have control. An owner's requirements and expectations are specified during the programming phase of a project and these define a design's scope of work. One focus of Target Value Design (TVD) is making owner's value a primary driver of design by improving project definition during programming-thus optimizing the design phase. While the number of published research articles praising TVD has been increasing, there is a dearth of information regarding the application of architectural programming (AP) to Target Value Design exercises, which engage stakeholders in a design decision making process called Choosing by Advantages (CBA). CBA first requires identification of attributes that are of value to an owner. The purpose of this research was to explore the importance of architectural programming in helping to identify key attributes of value to an owner, and to report on a lean game designed and preliminarily validated by the authors to investigate the accuracy and perception of attribute identification through AP as represented by the game. © 27th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction, IGLC 2019.

        <gf:abstract>Tubular origami may provide both the needed deployment displacement and sufficient strength to be useful as deployable structures. This paper reviews origami tube-based deployable mechanisms and a structural optimization of FEA models is performed. Symmetric and non-symmetric 4-sided tubes are evaluated. Panel geometries and thicknesses are varied to produce rigidly foldable origami-tube-based mechanisms that are both strong and lightweight. The mechanical properties of these tubes over various deployment lengths are discussed. Three different configurations of this mechanism are compared and the advantages of each are discussed.

        <gf:abstract>Some industrial gas turbines are currently being fired directly using heavy fuel oil, which contains a small percentage of inorganic material that can lead to fouling and corrosion of turbine components. Deposits of heavy fuel oil ash were created in the Turbine Accelerated Deposition Facility (TADF) at Brigham Young University under gas turbine-related conditions. Ash was produced by burning heavy fuel oil in a downward-fired combustor and collecting the ash from the exhaust stream. The mass mean ash particle diameter from these tests was 33 microns. This ash was then introduced into the TADF and entrained in a hot gas flow that varied from 1088 to 1206¡C. The gas and particle velocity was accelerated to over 200 m/s in these tests. This particle-laden hot gas stream then impinged on a nickel base superalloy metal coupon approximately 3 cm in diameter, and an ash deposit formed on the coupon. Sulfur dioxide was introduced to the system to achieve 1.1 mol% SO2 in the exhaust stream in order to simulate SO2 levels in turbines currently burning heavy fuel oil. The ash deposits were collected, and the capture efficiency, surface roughness, and deposit composition were measured. The deposits were then washed with deionized water, dried, and underwent the same analysis. It was found that, as the gas temperature increased, there was no effect on capture efficiency and the post-wash roughness of the samples decreased. Washing aided in the removal of sulfur, magnesium, potassium, and calcium. Copyright © 2017 ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>As municipalities across the United States and Canada focus on delivering the essentials of clean water, efficient wastewater treatment, and judicious control of storm water, government officials, engineers, and the companies that install, operate, and maintain piping infrastructure need to understand that a life cycle systems approach. Sustainability concerns apply to many critical resources such as water. On a per capita basis, the U.S. leads the world in water usage, with a substantial portion of water consumed/leaked by infrastructure systems. Because of water availability, competing water demands, and changing hydrologic conditions, the U.S. Department of Interior predicts that multiple water conflicts will occur in the western U.S. by 2025. In addition, decades of excessive demands on ecological systems have reduced their capacities to absorb and process emissions and wastes. Sustainable water infrastructure is vital to providing the American public with clean and safe water and helping to ensure the environmental, economic, and social health of the nation's communities. The increasing interest in sustainability has led to the development of sustainability assessment tools such as life cycle assessments (LCA) analyzing the embodied energy and environmental impacts. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool used to identify the environmental impacts of a product, process, or activity over the entire lifespan of the product. LCA studies also quantify and interpret the environmental flows to and from the environment (including emissions to air, water, and land, as well as the consumption of energy and other material resources) over the entire life cycle of a product (or process or service). By including the impacts throughout the product life cycle, LCA provides a comprehensive view of the environmental aspects of the product and an accurate picture of the true environmental tradeoffs in product selection. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm allows for a more time-efficient method of searching a specified area than a single UAV or piloted plane. There are a variety of factors that affect how well an area is surveyed. We specifically analyzed the effect both vehicle properties and communication had on the swarm search performance. We used non-dimensionalization to examine the effect vehicle properties had on search performance so the results can be applied to any domain size with any number and type of vehicle. We found that even if vehicles could only sense 10% of the grid area at any given time step, 92% of the grid could still be searched by using a vehicle with good maneuverability and endurance. Conversely, if the chosen vehicle had poor maneuverability 92% of the grid could still be searched by keeping the endurance high and increasing the amount of area the vehicles could sense at one time to 70% of the domain area. In addition, we also examined four communication cases with different amounts of information regarding vehicle location. We found communication increased search performance by at least 6.3%. However, increasing the amount of information only changed the performance by 2.3%. © 2019 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. All rights reserved.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>We present a general technique for achieving kinematic single degree of freedom (1DOF) origami-based mechanisms with thick rigid panels using synchronized offset rolling contact elements (SORCEs). We present general design analysis for planar and 3D relative motions between panels and show physically realized examples. The technique overcomes many of the limitations of previous approaches for thick rigidly foldable mechanisms. © 2017 by ASME.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Contractors are increasingly requesting to use flowable fill (CLSM) or lightweight cellular concrete (LCC) to replace compacted granular backfill at bridge abutments because they can be placed more rapidly. In addition, LCC reduces the settlement of the underlying soils which is attractive to engineers. To evaluate the passive force-deflection curves for these materials, large-scale lab tests were performed with LCC and CLSM backfills in addition to a granular backfill for comparison. The response of the LCC was similar to that of the granular backfill with somewhat higher peak force developing at about 2.5% of the wall height. Although the stiffness was about twice as high as the granular backfill, the post-peak reduction was less than that for the granular fill. In contrast, the CLSM had a stiffness about 10 times higher than the granular fill and reached the peak value at a deflection equal to 1% of the wall height. The CLSM experienced a rapid decease in strength of about 60% after the peak strength was reached. The ductility of the LCC makes it a more suitable material for seismic loading with higher displacement demands. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This paper summarizes the design of a discrete-time quadrature downconversion and resampling processor that operates on samples of a 70 MHz IF signal. The unique properties of discrete-time processing-aliasing due to resampling bandpass signals and polyphase filter decompositions- are applied to create a low-complexity approach that does not require any arithmetic operations at the IF sample rate. The required tasks are performed in two stages: a downsample-by-2 operation followed by a more traditional resampler based on a polyphase filterbank.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Small spot size laser testing for single-event effects has proven to be a particularly productive path to insights on the physics of charge collection and circuit response that are difficult or impossible to obtain through broad ion beam tests. As a result, there are a number of such laser facilities; for example, four of them were compared in 2012 [1], but a relatively new facility at the facility at the University of Saskatchewan offers a unique galvo-mirror, laser-spot scanning capability in addition to the usual micrometer-based DUT motion stage [2]. Operating in a fashion similar to LASIX eye surgery, fast pin-point redirection of the laser beam makes tractable (seconds, not hours or days) comprehensive scanning of a millimeter size field-of-view. Combined with auto-stepping the field-of-view, this new spot scanning capability opens up the possibility of comprehensively covering a large die and finding all SEE sites, including the rare, but important, ones such as SEFIs. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The aim of the paper is to evaluate a set of recently proposed engineering methods of gas radiation. For this purpose, a 3D stochastic ray tracing code was developed to treat realistic geometries. Model parameters based on the same LBL dataset were constructed for all approximate methods. Comparisons consist of two steps: 1/ a set of rays randomly spread over the unit sphere is chosen and narrow band models are assessed against LBL calculations. The most accurate narrow band method is chosen as the reference, 2/ all models are then compared with the chosen reference. For the cases considered in this paper, it was found that: 1/ the l-distribution approach is more accurate than Ck methods and can be used as the reference; 2/ the RC-SLW model provides very accurate predictions; 3/ the WSGG technique, which is the fastest method considered in this work, provides acceptable estimations, even in highly non-isothermal situations. © Begell House Inc. 2020.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Climate change caused by excessive CO2 emissions in the atmosphere has attracted widespread public concern in recent years. Current industrial methods generally utilize monoethanolamine for CO2 capture; however, the CO2 regeneration requires a high temperature and energy demand during every adsorption/desorption process, along with material losses. Many solid amines with high capture capacity and stability are developed as adsorbents to overcome the limitations. However, the environmental impacts caused by adsorbents themselves are not holistically considered and discussed; meanwhile, material syntheses and consumptions are also associated with CO2 emission. To determine the environmental impacts and identify hotspots of novel CO2 capture adsorbents, two carbon nanotube supported polyethyleneimine, physically adsorbed and covalently bonded, were compared with traditional monoethanolamine method using life cycle assessment. The carbon payback periods were also analyzed to gain understanding on whether the currently evaluated novel materials are suitable for industrial application. Results suggest that, material usage, especially carbon nanotubes, contributes the majority of the overall environmental impacts for both types of carbon nanotube supported polyethyleneimine. Meanwhile, their carbon payback periods are over 40 times longer than monoethanolamine during the synthesis phase. However, the energy consumption of physically adsorbed polyethyleneimine saves up to 60% compared to monoethanolamine in every adsorption/desorption cycle due to its lower heat capacity. In addition, the rate of cumulative CO2 remission for carbon nanotube supported polyethyleneimine is twice higher than monoethanolamine, indicating the potential application for industrial CO2 capture. Overall, our study indicates that current status of solid amine has a potential in CO2 capture, but requires much improvements. Future research should pay attention on decreasing the initial material synthesis and increasing the product life time due to their high environmental tradeoffs. Meanwhile, our study highlights that unilateral emphasis of the CO2 capture efficiency by novel materials may not be adequate, comprehensive considerations should be focused on the comparison throughout material life cycles including use and preparation phases. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>While the phenomena of soot formation in gaseous flames is well studied and understood, extension of the fundamental mechanisms to systems containing complex solid fuels can introduce large uncertainties and inaccuracies. In this study, we have developed a detailed physicsbased model for predicting the evolution of soot particles formed in systems containing complexsolid fuels such as wood or coal. This detailed physics-based model includes two particle-size distributions: that for soot particles and for soot precursor molecules. Sub-models for precursor creation, growth, and thermal cracking are included along with soot particle nucleation, coagulation, surface growth, aggregation, oxidation, and gasification. Validation work is presented comparing experimental results for a coal flame and biomass gasifier against model predicted values for soot concentrations and size distributions. The full detailed model can be computationally expensive when incorporated into CFD simulations; therefore, model simplifications are explored and presented in this work along with some preliminary work of applying particle formation physics to wildfire simulations.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>There is a growing need to develop effective interaction methods that enable a single operator to manage a team of multiple robots. This paper presents a novel approach that involves treating the team as a moldable volume, in which deformations of the volume correspond to changes in team shape. The team possesses a level of autonomy that allows the team to travel to and surround buildings of interest in a patrol and cordon scenario. During surround mode, the operator explores or manipulates the team shape to create desired formations around a building. A spacing interaction method also allows the operator to adjust how robots are spaced within the current shape. Separate haptic feedback is developed for each method to allow the operator to "feel" the shape or spacing manipulation. During travel mode, the operator chooses desired travel locations and receives feedback to help identify how and where the team travels. Results from a user study suggest that haptic feedback significantly improves operator performance in a reconnaissance task when task demand is higher, but may slightly increase operator workload. In the context of the experimental setup, these results suggest that haptic feedback may contribute to heads-up control of a team of autonomous robots. There were no significant differences in levels of situation awareness due to haptic feedback in this study. © 2017 ACM.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Given the overwhelming increase in technological advancements and global warming concerns, our study attempts to investigate the predictive powers of green human resource management (GHRM) bundles and green team creativity on green product innovation. Additionally, we examine the roles of technological turbulence and environmental dynamic capability. We have administered a cross-sectional (time lag) survey design with 229 respondents from 31 manufacturing organisations in Malaysia and employed the partial least square path modelling (SmartPLS3) for data analysis. Results indicate that technological turbulence, green recruitment and selection and green training, involvement and development are positive predictors of green team creativity. Green performance and compensation negatively predict green team creativity. While green team creativity positively predicts green product innovation, environmental dynamic capability negatively predicts green product innovation. Technological turbulence reinforces the positive impact of green recruitment and selection on green team creativity and dampens the positive impact of green training, involvement and development on green team creativity. Furthermore, green team creativity is a complementary and competitive mediator. By simultaneously investigating the predictive powers of technological turbulence, green team creativity and environmental dynamic capability in our study, we offer novel insights that extend traditional HRM conceptualisations to reflect a more environmentally sustainable GHRM framework. Policy implications and future directions are also discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Developable mechanisms conform to and emerge from developable, or specially curved, surfaces. The cylindrical developable mechanism can have applications in many industries due to the popularity of cylindrical or tube-based devices. Laparoscopic surgical devices in particular are widely composed of instruments attached at the proximal end of a cylindrical shaft. In this paper, properties of cylindrical developable mechanisms are discussed, including their behaviors, characteristics, and potential functions. One method for designing cylindrical developable mechanisms is discussed. Two example developable surgical devices that exemplify these behaviors, characteristics, and functions, along with the kinematic mechanisms comprising them, are discussed in detail.

        <gf:abstract>This paper explores power system network observability while taking into account realistic communication network behavior. The overall information is obtained by combining SCADA-and phasor measurement unit-derived data, where time stamping (based on Global Positioning System or an equivalent local clock) for all measurements is assumed. Based on simulations performed in communication Network Simulator 2, empirical cumulative distribution functions can be associated with transfer times of measurement packets, which will reflect communication parameters and irregularities. This is further used to form an algorithm which maximizes the number of successful network observability checks, and thus the number of possible state estimations, in a certain time period. Application is demonstrated on the IEEE 14-bus test power system example. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This research used a discrete event simulation to create data on a shipment receiving process instead of using historical records on the process. The simulation was used to create records with different inputs and operating conditions and the resulting overall elapsed time for the overall process. The resulting records were used to create a set of predictive artificial neural network models that predicted elapsed time based on the process characteristics. Then, the connection weight approach was used to determine the relative importance of the input variables. The connection weight approach was applied in three different steps: (1) on all input variables to identify predictive and non-predictive inputs, (2) on all predictive inputs, and (3) after removal of a dominating predictive input. This produced a clearer picture of the relative importance of input variables on the outcome variable than applying the connection weight approach once. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This paper describes a method of automatic sensor bias calculation for angle only sensor models in a target tracking scenario. It is assumed that separate Kalman filters are employed by each sensor and no measurements of known landmarks are available. Accurate bias estimation is achieved through the use of pseudo measurements of slant range from each sensor to the target and pseudo measurements of each sensor's bias. The covariance intersection (CI) algorithm is used to produce a pseudo measurement of slant range. This pseudo measurement of range allows pseudo measurements of sensor bias to be calculated based on each sensor's residuals and Kalman gains. Substantially improved tracking performance is demonstrated when estimating and accounting for constant biases on each sensor. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>To improve predictions of composite behavior under thermal loads, there is a need to measure the axial thermophysical properties of thin fibers. Current methods to accomplish this have prohibitively long lead times due to extensive sample preparation. This work details the use of quantum dots thermomarkers to measure the surface temperature of thin fibers in a non-contact manner and determine the fibersÕ thermal diffusivity. Neural networks are trained on extracting the temperature of a sample from fluorescence spectra in calibrated, steady-state conditions, based on different spectral features such as peak intensity and peak wavelength. The trained neural networks are then used to reconstruct the evolution of the surface temperature in transient heating experiments. In order to determine the thermal properties of a thin fiber, modulated laser heating is applied and an FFT-based method is used to extract the phase and amplitude response of the temperature field at the modulation frequency. The spatiotemporal dependence of the fluorescence signal, obtained by scanning the distance between the excitation and detection laser spots and varying the frequency response due to an axial scan and a frequency scan, is then curve-fit to the resulting decay curves by a photothermal model in order to determine the thermal diffusivity of the fiber. The measured thermal diffusivity (3.3Ê±Ê0.8Ê_Ê10_7Êm2Ês_1) of a synthetic spider silk fiber by the current method has similar properties to other synthetic silk fibers, and demonstrates the ability of the current method to more rapidly measure thermophysical properties of thin fibers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>New presentation-feedback technologies enable peers and instructors to provide real-time qualitative feedback on oral presentations. Previous research suggests that summative quantitative ratings of peers and instructors tend to be moderately reliable, but no research exists on how substantive qualitative ratings compare. Analyzing the substantive qualitative feedback from 10 students and 10 instructors on two professional presentations, this study analyzes differences in the message- and messenger-related comments of peers and instructors. Findings suggest that instructors provide proportionally more messenger-related feedback. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Electromagnetic (EM) motion tracking systems are suitable for many research and clinical applications, including in vivo measurements of whole-arm movements. Unfortunately, the methodology for in vivo measurements of whole-arm movements using EM sensors is not well described in the literature, making it difficult to perform new measurements and all but impossible to make meaningful comparisons between studies. The recommendations of the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) have provided a great service, but by necessity they do not provide clear guidance or standardization on all required steps. The goal of this paper was to provide a comprehensive methodology for using EM sensors to measure whole-arm movements in vivo. We selected methodological details from past studies that were compatible with the ISB recommendations and suitable for measuring whole-arm movements using EM sensors, filling in gaps with recommendations from our own past experiments. The presented methodology includes recommendations for defining coordinate systems (CSs) and joint angles, placing sensors, performing sensor-to-body calibration, calculating rotation matrices from sensor data, and extracting unique joint angles from rotation matrices. We present this process, including all equations, for both the right and left upper limbs, models with nine or seven degrees-of-freedom (DOF), and two different calibration methods. Providing a detailed methodology for the entire process in one location promotes replicability of studies by allowing researchers to clearly define their experimental methods. It is hoped that this paper will simplify new investigations of whole-arm movement using EM sensors and facilitate comparison between studies. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

        <gf:abstract>Leveraging virtual reality (VR) technology to enhance engineering design reviews has been an area of significant interest for researchers since the advent of modern VR. The ability to interact meaningfully with 3D computer-aided engineering models in these VR design reviews is an important, though often neglected, capability due to the difficulty of performing data translation between native computer-aided design (CAD) data and VR compatible file formats. A bi-directional interface was developed between a VR design review environment and a commercial CAD package that streamlines the data translation process. Transmitting both geometric data and selected metadata from the CAD system enabled the development of enhanced model interaction tools in a VR design review application. User experiments were performed that compared the enhanced tools developed to a baseline toolset. Participants success using these toolsets was measured as they performed tasks related to design understanding and decision making, such as counting the number of gears in a gearbox or evaluating the feasibility of a proposed design change in a four-cylinder engine. The analysis of the data from these experiments showed a statistically significant improvement in participants ability to understand the geometry of the model correctly, confidently, and quickly, as well as in participants ability to correctly and confidently understand the implications of a proposed design change when using the Enhanced Toolset. We conclude that the bi-directional interface concept developed in this work can be extended to enable advanced interaction with a diversity of engineering data in VR. © 2017, Springer-Verlag France.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This work introduces a type of motion termed Òconceal-and-revealÓ which is characterized by a state that protects a payload, a state that exposes the payload, and continuous motion between these two states. As techniques for thick, rigid origami-based engineering design are being developed, origami is becoming increasingly more attractive as inspiration for complex systems. This paper proposes a process for designing origami-based conceal-and-reveal systems, which can be generalized to design other thick, rigid origami-based systems. The process is demonstrated through the development of three conceal-and-reveal systems that present a luxury product to the consumer. The three designs also confirm that multiple origami crease patterns represent viable approaches to achieving conceal-and-reveal motion. Copyright © 2018 ASME</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The design of long, linear infrastructure such as pipelines, levees, roads, and canals can be challenging in areas of moderate to high seismicity due to numerous seismic and geologic hazards that can be encountered along proposed alignments. One of the most challenging earthquake-related hazards in the design of large infrastructure is liquefaction-induced lateral spread displacement. This paper presents a new simplified probabilistic approach to estimate lateral spread displacements at targeted return periods across large geographic areas using performance-based lateral spread displacement reference parameter maps and (if available) site-specific geotechnical information. The approach is demonstrated on a hypothetical pipeline extending from Rock Springs, Wyoming, to West Bountiful, Utah, in the United States. Advantages and limitations of the proposed approach are discussed. The results of the demonstrative calculation show how the approach can be used to identify areas where additional geotechnical investigations might be needed, and how probabilistic lateral spread displacements can be easily predicted along numerous proposed alignments of the pipeline once geotechnical subsurface investigation and ground surveys become available. © 2017 ASCE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>We present theory for operation and experimental results for a nanoscale pump implemented in silica thin films that uses electrostatic actuation. The devices were implemented on silicon substrates using standard microfabrication recipes. Using pressures induced by capillary forces, the pressures exerted on pump membranes through electrostatic forces, and the approximate displacement per stroke we predict the pump speed operating the device over a range of frequencies and voltages. For membranes 100 nm thick, 170 V was required for pump actuation, providing exquisite control of pumping rates of less than 1 fl s-1 per nanochannel. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Performance-based earthquake engineering analysis methods are desirable in geotechnical engineering due to their ability to incorporate the various uncertainties associated with complex problems and their ability to frame responses in terms of a targeted hazard. However, such methods are difficult to implement on routine projects without the use of specialized software because the many iterative probabilistic calculations required. Prior research has introduced a simplified approach of using performance-based reference parameter maps in conjunction with correction equations that account for site-specific geotechnical and topographical conditions. This paper addresses the development of such performance-based reference parameter maps for the calculation of post-liquefaction volumetric strains and settlements in the free field. A study is performed and presented to assess the optimized grid spacing for a performance-based volumetric strain analysis and development of a strain performance-based reference parameter map. Recommended grid spacing values as correlated to USGS seismic hazard maps for PGA are provided to produce a maximum of 0.15% strain error in interpolating the reference strain for the simplified performance-based analysis approach. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Last year we initiated the use of Instagram into our design history course at an introductory level. This year we explored further integration of Instagram as an academic tool. This study included twenty-two undergraduate participants who prototyped five new classroom uses of Instagram: posting full student presentations, utilising Instagram desktop view as the primary in-class presentation tool, employing templates enabling a cohesive visual identity and a simple search process, and methods to enhance student comments. We surveyed course participants mid-semester asking students about their personal Instagram use, the value and purpose they felt Instagram had in the course, and on the usefulness of the presentation templates. We learned that while the majority of students use Instagram in their daily life, few of them make comments on personal or course posts and will only do so for credit. We also learned that while students might not enjoy using Instagram in the course, they find it of value and highly meaningful. Finally, the students prefer using formatted templates over an open style like PowerPoint to build their presentations in. These templates enabled the students to post their full presentations and created a visual cohesiveness for the account while providing a rudimentary search process for individual posts. We will continue using Instagram in future courses with the exception of requiring comments. We believe that students will reference their class posts in years to come, and as they do, it will re-enforce their design knowledge and provide evidence of their personal growth. © 2019 Institution of Engineering Designers, The Design Society.

        <gf:abstract>We present a geometrically exact isogeometric blended shell formulation. In other words, all geometric quantities appearing in the blended theory are evaluated exactly and no approximations are employed. The blended approach allows higher-order shell theories, like Kirchhoff-Love, to be combined with Reissner-Mindlin shell formulations, which have rotational degrees of freedom. In this way, rotations can be employed only where needed to simplify shell modeling such as at kinks and intersections. Away from these regions shear locking free formulations can be employed to improve robustness, accuracy, and efficiency. We compare our approach to standard shell elements commonly used in industry on several benchmarks to explore the behavior of the element. We then model an inner car hood to demonstrate our ability to handle complex CAD geometry in a simple manner without geometry cleanup and mesh generation steps. This shell element forms the basis of the newly developed Isogeometrx structural solver. © 2017 SAE International.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Flexible printed circuit boards (PCBs) make it possible for engineers to design devices that use space efficiently and can undergo changes in shape and configuration. However, they also suffer from tradeoffs due to nonideal material properties. Here, a method is presented that allows engineers to introduce regions of flexibility in otherwise rigid PCB substrates. This method employs geometric features to reduce local stiffness in the PCB, rather than reducing the global stiffness by material selection. Analytical and finite element models are presented to calculate the maximum stresses caused by deflection. An example device is produced and tested to verify the models.

        <gf:abstract>We propose adding an irregular quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellation to a wireless transmission scheme in order to obtain greater control over the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required to successfully decode the signal. By altering the separation between adjacent symbols, the minimum required SNR is raised without degradation in the performance of the scheme. This allows the system to adapt to preferable channel conditions for the authorized user, making it harder for eavesdroppers to intercept and decode the transmission, thus making the communication safer. In addition, we show that by overlaying a coset code onto the QAM constellation, a new, stronger security gap metric can be further improved. Results show the effectiveness of this strategy with an interleaved coding for secrecy with a hidden key (ICSHK) scheme. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Kestrel is a tool developed by the Computational Research and Engineering Acquisition Tools and Environments-Air Vehicles (CREATE-AV) Program to expedite the acquisition process of fixed-wing aircraft. KestrelÕs capabilities include simulating internal flow, including within turbomachinery. Mixing plane methods are often used for modeling flow in gas turbine engine turbomachinery in order to evaluate multiple designs quickly. Because KestrelÕs mixing plane capabilities have been demonstrated in only limited cases, this research seeks to further validate the model using the Air Force Research LabÕs (AFRL) Rotor 4 fan. Extensive experimental data has been gathered for Rotor 4, allowing for in-depth comparisons to be made. Following the validation study, differences between the experimental results and the predictions from the mixing plane model are highlighted and discussed. These comparisons lead the authors to conclude that KestrelÕs mixing planes can be utilized to predict performance at various operating conditions and rotor speeds. This research serves to further KestrelÕs development and use by the Department of Defense (DoD) for aircraft acquisition. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

        <gf:abstract>This paper begins by summarizing a recent advancement in the way that shaped offset quadrature phase shift keying (SOQPSK) waveforms can be viewed. This new viewpoint succeeds in eliminating the need for SOQPSK to be thought of as a ÒspecialÓ kind of correlated, ternary continuous phase modulation (CPM). Instead, SOQPSK can be viewed as an ordinary, binary CPM. We provide all of the details necessary to achieve a complete unification of SOQPSK models at the waveform level, at the bit sequence level, and in terms of waveform initialization. With this information, SOQPSK users can easily mix and match SOQPSK models at the transmitter and receiver in order to make use of the advantages of each model. © held by the author; distribution rights International Foundation for Telemetering.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This article reports study results in which participants (n=145) responded to a variety of negative messages in a variety of message channels, visual, textual, and verbal. Participants participated in A-B testing of distinct message strategies and then identified communication values that seemed most important in distinct message contexts. Results showed very clear differences between two broad classes of negative information: negative information about perceived physical facts (e.g. the presence of hazardous materials or dangerous conditions) as opposed to negative information about social relationships (e.g., a romantic breakup, the death of a loved one, or termination of employment). Participants consistently identified directness as a communicative virtue, even in contexts where they preferred a message format with a consistently small buffer in order to also satisfy a perceived need for politeness. Conversely, explanatory information prior to bad news was never preferred over bad-news-first in cases involving physical-fact bad news. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Multiple reflections in a cavity geometry augment the emission and absorption of the cavity opening relative to a flat surface in a phenomenon known as the cavity effect. The extent of the cavity effect is quantified using apparent absorptivity and apparent emissivity. Analysis of complicated thermal systems is simplified through application of apparent radiative properties to cavity geometries. The apparent radiative properties of a specularly-reflecting, gray, isothermal V-groove have been derived analytically, but these results have not been validated experimentally or numerically. Additionally, the model for apparent absorptivity of an infinite V-groove subjected to partial illumination in the presence of collimated irradiation is not available. In this work, the following existing models for a specularly-reflecting V-groove are collected into a single source: (1) the apparent absorptivity of a diffusely irradiated V-groove, (2) the apparent emissivity of an isothermal V-groove and (3) the apparent absorptivity of a V-groove subject to collimated irradiation with full-illumination. Further, a new analytical model is developed to predict the apparent absorptivity of an infinite V-groove subject to collimated irradiation with partial-illumination. A custom, Monte Carlo ray tracing solver is used to predict the apparent radiative properties for all cases as a means of numerical verification by comparing the ray tracing data with the results from the new model in this work and the previously existing models. For diffuse irradiation, the analytical model and ray tracing data show excellent agreement with an average discrepancy of 4.4 _ 10_4, verifying the diffuse-irradiation analytical model. Similar agreement is found for collimated irradiation, where the full and partial illumination models indicate average discrepancies of 4.9 _ 10_4 and 4.6 _ 10_4 when compared with ray tracing data. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Friction stir welding has gained wide interest in industry and drawn large research attention due to its high level of automation and superior joint performance. In this study we further expand the welding parameters to be of magnitudes higher than those previously reported to lower the cost and enable high volume joint production. Sound butt-joints were produced with aluminum alloy 6111-T4 blanks with welding speeds up to 6000, mm/min. Tensile tests of the joint pieces show &gt;97% joint efficiency in terms of ultimate tensile strength. The T4 natural aging and grain refinement is found to contribute to the superior joint properties. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis is used to qualitatively study the local shear texture inside the nugget zones of the welds. The shear texture result is a good indicator of the material flow directions in the nugget zones. The flow directions behind the rotation tool are found to be flattened towards the top surface of the workpiece when the welding speed is increased, suggesting intense material mixing and transportation along the longitudinal welding direction (WD). © The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society 2018.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>An analytical investigation of thermal transport due to laminar, buoyant flow past a vertical superhydrophobic (SHPo) surface was performed. The surface temperature is uniform and is greater than the temperature of the surrounding liquid. Uniform stream-wise hydrodynamic slip and temperature jump were imposed at the wall to model the SHPo surface. Applying an integral analysis within the boundary layer results in a system of differential equations, which was solved numerically to obtain boundary layer thickness and local and average values of the Nusselt number. The classical smooth hydrophobic scenario with no-slip and no temperature jump showed excellent agreement with previous analyses of the same problem. Solutions were obtained for laminar Rayleigh number ranging from 104 to 109 at a Prandtl number of 7. There was a modest decrease in the boundary layer thickness due to the increased slip length and the flow velocity decreased due to the increased temperature jump length. The local Nusselt number decreased as the temperature jump length increased, with greater reduction at larger Rayleigh numbers and near the lower edge. The decrease in the average Nusselt number relative to surfaces with no-slip and no temperature jump may be as much as 50%. © 2019</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The Coanda effect is the behavior of a fluid flowing next to a solid surface which creates a change in pressure, thereby causing the fluid to attach to the surface. Little is known concerning the Coanda effect as it pertains to flame attachment in relation to wildfires. There is a need for improvement in the correlations between fire behavior on or near a slope and fire safety zones. An understanding of this effect could lead to more reliable guidelines for the establishment of firefighter safety zones, which are regions in wildfire areas that have been determined as safe for the survival of the firefighter. This paper discusses the ability of two commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes (Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and STAR-CCM+) to model the results of actual flame experiments near barren slopes. Simulation results were compared to measured values of flame attachment length and radiative and convective heat fluxes. Pressure and temperature gradient measurements along the slope are reported. Proper modeling of small-scale experiments with such software packages can lead to more confidence in large scale simulations and eventual development of firefighter safety zones in wildfires.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This work experimentally explores sub-boiling pool nucleation on micro-structured superhydrophobic surfaces. All surfaces tested were submerged in a 20 mm deep pool of water and heated from below to maintain a constant surface temperature, while the side walls of the pool were insulated, and the top was covered. Three thermocouples positioned in the pool obtain the average pool temperature. A heat flux sensor is placed directly beneath the surface to measure the heat flux supplied to the pool. Free convection heat transfer coefficients are obtained for the sub-boiling temperature range of 40Ð90 ¡C. Six surface types are studied: smooth hydrophilic, smooth hydrophobic, superhydrophobic with rib/cavity structures, superhydrophobic with rib/cavity structures and additional sparsely spaced ribs to close off the cavities, circular posts, and circular holes. It is found that structured superhydrophobic surfaces provide cavities for nucleation to occur. More dissolved air effervesces from the water as the surface temperature increases due to an increased level of supersaturation and convection. The nucleation leads to large air bubble formations that reduce the overall convection coefficient when compared to the smooth surfaces. For the rib/cavity structured surfaces, the bubbles form in an anisotropic manner and are aligned with the surface structure. More bubbles are observed on the superhydrophobic surfaces where the cavities are bounded. Since water's ability to dissolve air is dependent on temperature, heat and mass transfer cannot be treated independently on any of the superhydrophobic surfaces studied here. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Structurally radiated sound power is a critical design parameter. The acoustic radiation mode approach for computing sound power was developed in the early 1990s and has since been widely used. It has been shown to be a rather efficient approach for determining the radiated sound power. In previous research, radiation mode expressions have been developed for planar and spherical structures, as well as axisymmetric modes of internal and external radiation from cylinders. In this work, the radiation modes for external radiating cylinders which account for both axial and circumferential dependence are presented. The expressions are uniquely developed using cylindrical basis functions which are a more natural match to the geometry than past developments, which have been based on spherical harmonics. Higher order radiation modes than have been previously presented are shown. The Òleapfrog effectÓ, whereby higher order modes leapfrog over lower modes in terms of their radiation efficiencies as the frequency goes above the cut-on frequency for those modes, is discussed in detail. The relationships between the mode efficiency and the coincidence effect associated with the cut-on frequencies of the vibration modes are described. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>In goal-based tasks such as navigating a robot from location A to location B in a dynamic environment, human intent can mean to choose a specific trade-off between multiple competing objectives. For example, intent can mean to find a path that balances between "Go quickly" and "Go stealthily". Given human expectations about how a path balances such tradeoffs, the path should match the human's intent throughout the entire execution of the path even if the environment changes. If the path drifts from the human's intent because the environment changes, then a new robotic-path needs to be planned - referred to as path-replanning. We discuss here three system-initiated triggers (prompts) for path-replanning. The objective is to create an interactive replanning system that yields paths that consistently match human intent. The triggers are to replan (a) at regular time intervals, (b) when the current robotic path deviates from the user intent, and (c) when a better path can be obtained from a different homotopy class. Further, we consider one user-generated replanning trigger that allows the user to stop the robot anytime to put the robot onto a new route. These four trigger variants seek to answer two fundamental critical questions: When is a re-planned path acceptable to a human? and How should a planner involve a human in replanning? © 2018 SPIE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Engineers in industry are increasingly called on to work with teammates located in multiple geographic locations (virtual teams). Engineering education has an interest in helping students learn how to best collaborate in these types of situations. Four years of multi-university, multi-disciplinary engineering capstone projects are investigated and related literature is thoroughly examined to demonstrate which collaboration tools, at different stages of the product development process, meet the needs of virtual team members for communication tasks. Student engineering design teams with team members located at various locations should, during the early, middle, and late stages of the product development process, emphasize the use of collaboration tools that will best meet the needs of each stage. In the early stages, teams should emphasize rich communication mediums, such as in-person kick-off meetings. In the middle stages, tools which allow team members to perform their individual work while staying in-sync with their remotely located teammates, such as web conferencing and shared data editing tools, become important. In the late stages, as the team shifts from digital work to physical work, tools such as texting and in-person meetings become more necessary. © 2018 TEMPUS Publications.</gf:abstract>

In the first step, channel support is recovered by combining compressed sensing techniques with the CFO estimate based on the non-sparsity constraint (NSC) on the channel. Next we use the estimated channel support to derive the SC CFO estimator. Simulations are performed to compare the performance of the SC CFO estimator against the existing NSC CFO estimators using shaped offset QPSK version TG (SOQPSK-TG) modulated iNET-formatted data over an aeronautical test channel. © held by the author; distribution rights International Foundation for Telemetering.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Wildland fire is an important component of many American ecosystems. Wildland fires can have necessary ecological influences in many North American ecosystems or can dangerously affect life, property and natural resources. These hazards decrease with the proper application of controlled burning. Controlled burning destroys smaller plants and also decreases combustible materials and the potential for ignition and fire propagation in the fuel bed. Fuel bed pyrolysis and ignition determine fire ignition and propagation rates in both wildland fires and prescribed burning, but the details of solid fuel reaction under wildland fire conditions remain poorly understood. The purpose of this study is to provide fundamental information about pyrolysis of live shrub fuels at slow heating rates. A programmable heater apparatus was used to study the pyrolysis products of three different kind of live shrubs from forests of the Southeastern United States. Low and high molecular weight pyrolysis products were collected in a cold trap and then analyzed using GC-MS.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of morbidity in military Veterans and Service Members. While most individuals recover fully from mild injuries within weeks, some continue to experience symptoms including headaches, disrupted sleep, and other cognitive, behavioral or physical symptoms. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) shows promise in identifying areas of structural disruption and predicting outcomes. Although some studies suggest widespread structural disruption after brain injury, dMRI studies of military brain injury have yielded mixed results so far, perhaps due to the subtlety of mild injury, individual differences in injury location, severity and mechanism, and co-morbidity with other disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and substance abuse. We present preliminary dMRI results from the ENIGMA (Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) military brain injury working group. We found higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in participants with a history of TBI. Understanding the injury and recovery process, along with factors that influence these, will lead to improved diagnosis and treatment. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>A novel algorithm for planning robotic manipulation tasks is presented in which the base position and joint motions of a robot are simultaneously optimized to follow a smooth desired end-effector trajectory. During the optimization routine, the manipulator's base position and joint motions are planned simultaneously by strategically moving a set of virtual robot arms (each representing a single configuration in a sequence) branching from a common base to a number of assigned target poses associated with a task. Additional goals (e.g. collision avoidance) and hard constraints, including joint limits are also incorporated. The optimization problem at the core of this method is a quadratic program, allowing constrained high-dimensional problems to be solved in very little time. This method has successfully planned motions allowing an 8-DOF manipulator to paint walls, and has proven to be highly efficient and scalable in practice. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Since the advent of modern computer-aided design software, engineers have been divorced from the highly collaborative environment previously enjoyed. Today's highly complex designs require modern software tools and the realities of a global economy often constrain engineers to remote collaboration. These conditions make it highly impractical to collaborate locally around physical models. Various approaches to creating new collaboration tools and software, which alleviate these issues, have been tried previously. However, past solutions either used expensive hardware, which is not widely available, or used standard two-dimensional (2D) monitors to share three-dimensional (3D) information. Recently, new low-cost virtual reality (VR) hardware has been introduced, which creates a highly immersive 3D experience at a tiny fraction of the cost of previous hardware. This work demonstrates an immersive collaborative environment built using a network of this hardware, which allows users to interact with gestures virtually and conducts a study to show its advantages over traditional video conferencing software.

        <gf:abstract>SRAM-based Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) logic devices are very attractive in applications where high data throughput is needed, such as the latest generation of High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments. FPGAs have been rarely used in such experiments because of their sensitivity to radiation. The present paper proposes a mitigation approach applied to commercial FPGA devices to meet the reliability requirements for the front-end electronics of the Liquid Argon (LAr) electromagnetic calorimeter of the ATLAS experiment, located at CERN. Particular attention will be devoted to define a proper mitigation scheme of the multi-gigabit transceivers embedded in the FPGA, which is a critical part of the LAr data acquisition chain. A demonstrator board is being developed to validate the proposed methodology. Mitigation techniques such as Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) and scrubbing will be used to increase the robustness of the design and to maximize the fault tolerance from Single-Event Upsets (SEUs). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Large-scale coal combustion simulations depend highly on the accuracy and utility of the physical submodels used to describe the various physical behaviors of the system. Coal combustion simulations depend on the particle physics to predict product compositions, temperatures, energy outputs, and other useful information. The focus of this paper is to improve the accuracy of devolatilization submodels, to be used in conjunction with other particle physics models. Many large simulations today rely on inaccurate assumptions about particle compositions, including that the volatiles that are released during pyrolysis are of the same elemental composition as the char particle. Another common assumption is that the char particle can be approximated by pure carbon. These assumptions will lead to inaccuracies in the overall simulation. There are many factors that influence pyrolysis product composition, including parent coal composition, pyrolysis conditions (including particle temperature history and heating rate), and others. All of these factors are incorporated into the correlations to predict the elemental composition of the major pyrolysis products, including coal tar, char, and light gases. © 2017 Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute.

        <gf:abstract>Origami tessellations have been proposed as a mechanism for control of radiative heat transfer through the use of the cavity effect. This work explores the impact of a changing projected surface area and varying apparent radiative properties on the net radiative heat transfer of an accordion fold comprised of V-grooves. The net radiative heat transfer of an accordion tessellation is obtained by a thermal energy balance at the cavity openings with radiative properties of the cavities given as a function of various cavity parameters. Results of the analytical model are experimentally confirmed. An accordion tessellation, constructed of stainless-steel shim stock, is positioned to achieve a specified fold angle and placed in a vacuum environment while heated by Joule heating. A thermal camera records the apparent temperature of the cavity openings for various fold angles. Results are compared to apparent temperatures predicted with the analytical model. Analytically and experimentally obtained temperatures agree within 5% and all measurements fall within experimental uncertainty. For diffusely irradiated surfaces, the decrease in projected surface area dominates, causing a continuous decrease in net radiative heat transfer for a collapsing accordion fold. Highly reflective specular surfaces exposed to diffuse irradiation experience large turn-down ratios (7.5_ reduction in heat transfer) in the small angle ranges. Specular surfaces exposed to collimated irradiation achieve a turn down ratio of 3.35 between V-groove angles of 120 deg and 150 deg. The approach outlined here may be extended to modeling the net radiative heat transfer for other origami tessellations. © 2019 by ASME.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>In a block-out connection, a steel column is connected to a footing through an opening (block-out) in a slab-on-grade that is later filled with unreinforced concrete. In design, engineers generally neglect any beneficial effects of the block-out concrete. The objective of this study is to experimentally quantify the effect of block-out concrete on the lower-bound flexural strength and stiffness of block-out connections at the base of steel moment frames. Eight specimens were tested with varying column shape, block-out depth, and baseplate/anchor rod designs. The block-out concrete increased the connection flexural strengths by 69%-91% for block-out depths that were 1.2-1.5 times the column depth. A strength model proposed in previous work was found to reasonably predict the flexural strength, accounting for the effects of block-out concrete. With regard to stiffness, specimens with block-out concrete depths at least 1.15 times the column depth could be accurately modeled as fixed at the top-of-footing elevation. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This paper investigates the performance of sparse minimum mean squared error (MMSE) equalizer for generalized time-reversed space-time block codes (GTR-STBC) in aeronautical telemetry. GTR-STBC equipped with MMSE equalizer performs the best trade-offbetween the signal-tonoise ratio and inter-symbol interference by allocating unequal power over aeronautical telemetry channels. However, aeronautical telemetry channels are in general consists of larger delay spreads which make the MMSE equalization of aeronautical channels with GTR-STBC computationally complex. Interestingly enough, in spite of larger delays aeronautical channels are made of few sparsely distributed multipaths and therefore their MMSE equalizers are highly compressible. In this paper, compressed sensing based greedy algorithm is used for the design of sparse MMSE equalizer and a convex curve-fitting algorithm is used to find the sub-optimum power allocation parameter at the same sparsity level for GTR-STBC. Our simulation results show that 75-90% of the non-zero equalizer taps can be reduced with a slight relaxation of the mean-squared error (or equivalently slight degradation of bit-error rate performance). It is also observed that the optimum transmitter power profile for the sparse MMSE equalizer is different than that of the non-sparse equalizer.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Refill Friction Stir Spot Welding (RFSSW) has demonstrated capability in joining thin sheets of aluminum with dissimilar thickness, alloy, and composition. The process remains to be implemented on a wide scale in the automotive and aerospace industries, partially due to the relatively short number of welds producible by a toolset, prior to needing cleaning. In the following work, an investigation was conducted to better understand this limitation. First, the effective tool life of a steel toolset was quantified. Experiments showed that less than 60 consecutive welds could be made before the toolset seized and required cleaning. To better understand the conditions contributing so such a short tool life, thermocouples were used in subsequent experiments, to measure the temperatures achieved at various locations in the weld. Peak weld temperature increased with longer cycle times and decreased with shorter cycle times. During the experiments, it was noted that weld temperatures in excess of 500 ¡C were observed at weld center. At these high temperatures, the authors anticipate that intermetallic compounds (IMCs) are able to grow on tool surfaces. A rough, existing model of IMC growth in an Fe-Al system predicted IMC growth on the same order of magnitude of the tool clearances, supporting the anticipation that IMC growth is a factor in the observed, short tool life between cleanings. Following this analysis, future evaluation of less re-active tool materials is recommended. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>In principle a wide range of organic materials can store energy in the form of reversible redox conversions of stable radicals. Such chemistry holds great promise for energy storage applications due to high theoretical capacities, high rate capabilities, intrinsic structural tunability, and the possibility of low-cost ÒgreenÓ syntheses from renewable sources. There have been steady improvements in the design of organic radical polymers, in which radicals are incorporated into the backbone and/or as pendant groups. This review highlights opportunities for improved redox molecule and polymer design along with the key challenges (e.g., transport phenomena, solubility, and reaction mechanisms) to transitioning known organic radicals into high-performance electrodes. Ultimately, organic-based batteries are still a nascent field with many open questions. Further advances in molecular design, electrode engineering, and device architecture will be required for these systems to reach their full potential and meet the diverse and increasing demands for energy storage. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This paper explores how displaying engineering research artifacts in art museums can facilitate expanded outreach opportunities. A combination of visual art and innovative engineering offers an unusual opportunity to engage a wide spectrum of society. To evaluate the potential, faculty and students collaborated with the Brigham Young University Museum of Art to create a museum exhibition that connected the art of origami to engineering, math, science, and product design. A framework is introduced that includes the creation of a museum exhibition; and once the initial investment is made to create the central exhibition, the results are efficiently used to extend outreach efforts through first-generation products (coincident with the exhibition) and then through second-generation products (after the exhibition). The paper describes a detailed example of this framework and provides evidence to support the concept that displaying research artifacts in an art museum can expand research opportunities. Products from the exhibition that provided expanded outreach opportunities include the following: an exhibit catalog originally created for the gift shop that was expanded for publication with a national publisher; a tablet/smart phone app that includes origami instructions followed by related engineering activities, which has had broad use beyond the museum activity room; a video that was prepared for museum patrons but has since been made available to larger audiences; materials created for hands-on museum activities that were used for outreach activities after the exhibition; and leverage for industry visits that led to additional applications and research projects. This paper describes the museum exhibition, the first- and second-generation products, the impact of each product, and the benefits and pitfalls of using a museum exhibition to extend outreach impact. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Uranium and thorium oxides have critical roles as fuels in existing nuclear power plants, as well as in proposed reactor concepts. The thermal conductivity of these materials determines their ability to transfer heat from the reactor core to the surrounding coolant. Additionally, these actinide compounds are of interest in condensed matter physics because of the 5f orbitals and unique electron interaction, coupling, and scattering events that can occur. Because of the radioactivity of thorium and uranium, thin film measurements of actinide materials are used to limit the amount of operator exposure, but standard thermal characterization methods are not well suited for thin films. This paper presents the process of depositing thin film UOx and ThOx samples of nm-_m thicknesses and the results of thermal property measurements. Thin films were deposited on silicon and glass substrates via dc-magnetron sputtering using an argon/oxygen mixture as the working gas. The thermal properties of the films were measured by the Thermal Conductivity Microscope (TCM). This uses one laser to generate thermal waves and a second laser to measure the magnitude and phases of the thermal waves to obtain the conductivity of materials. The results of the research show that the UOx film properties are lower than bulk values and that the role of the substrate has a considerable effect on determining the measured properties. Future work aims at improving the deposition process. Epitaxial film growth is planned. Additional understanding of thermal property measurements is targeted. Copyright © 2019 ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Comparing genomes to identify polymorphisms is a difficult task, especially beyond single nucleotide poly-morphisms. Polymorphism detection is important in disease association studies as well as in phylogenetic tree reconstruc-tion. We present a method for identifying polymorphisms in genomes by using a modified version de Bruijn graphs, data structures widely used in genome assembly from Next-Generation Sequencing. Using our method, we are able to identify polymorphisms that exist within a genome as well as well as see graph structures that form in the de Bruijn graph for particular types of polymorphisms (translocations, etc.) © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Managing reservoir sediments in the United States is becoming increasingly important as many projects now exceed their so-called design life. Environmental regulations, enacted without knowing that someday deposited sediments would need to be moved downstream, make the permitting process difficult and time consuming. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, recognizing the growing need for sediment management, are completing a Reservoir Sediment Information database for all of their projects and are training their employees on how to permit sediment management operations at dams and reservoirs. The Subcommittee on Sedimentation, part of the Advisory Committee on Water Information, has published a progressive resolution encouraging federal agencies to develop sediment management plans for all of their projects by the year 2020. They are also in the process of publishing a white paper on the permitting aspects of reservoir sediment management. An ongoing sediment management project at Millsite Dam on Ferron Creek in Utah, although not passing significant volumes of sediment downstream, can serve as an example of meeting the complex permit requirements associated with such activities. © 2018 ICOLD/CIGB, Paris, France.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The regional-sandwiching of compliant sheets (ReCS) technique presented in this work creates flat-foldable, rigid-foldable, and self-deploying thick origami-based mechanisms. Regional-sandwiching of the compliant sheet is used to create mountain/valley assignments for each fold about a vertex, constraining motion to a single branch of folding. Strain energy in deflected flexible members is used to enable self-deployment. This work presents the methods to design origami-based mechanisms using the ReCS technique, including volume trimming at the vertex of the compliant sheet and of the panels used in the sandwich. Physical models of a simple single fold mechanism and a degree-four vertex mechanism are presented to demonstrate the ReCS technique using acrylic panels and spring steel. Consideration is given to the risk of yielding of the compliant sheet due to parasitic motion with possible mitigation of yielding by decreasing the thickness of the sheet.

        <gf:abstract>This paper describes a 10-bit 5-kHz SAR ADC under an ultra-low-supply-voltage of 0.2 V for low-power applications. To tolerate the severe variations in the subthreshold regime, a novel dynamic bulk biasing circuit senses the NMOS/PMOS strength ratio in the background and applies feedback to recover the circuit functionality. A new comparator relaxes the stringent speed-noise trade-off under the 0.2-V supply. Employing ac-coupling, stacked input pairs, and voltage-boosted load capacitors, the comparator achieves more than threefold improvement in speed with little noise penalty. The measured ADC consumes 22 nW and exhibits an SNDR of 52.8 dB at Nyquist, yielding an FoM of 12.3 fJ/conv.-step.

    <gf:abstract>Inflatable robots are naturally lightweight and compliant, which may make them well suited for operating in unstructured environments or in close proximity to people. The inflatable joints used in this article consist of a strong fabric exterior that constrains two opposing compliant air bladders that generate torque (unlike McKibben actuators where pressure changes cause translation). This antagonistic structure allows the simultaneous control of position and stiffness. However, dynamic models of soft robots that allow variable stiffness control have not been well developed. In this work, a model that includes stiffness as a state variable is developed and validated. Using the stiffness model, a sliding mode controller and model predictive controller are developed to control stiffness and position simultaneously. For sliding mode control (SMC), the joint stiffness was controlled to within 0.07 Nm/rad of a 45 Nm/rad command. For model predictive control (MPC) the joint stiffness was controlled to within 0.045 Nm/rad of the same stiffness command. Both SMC and MPC were able to control to within 0.5¡ of a desired position at steady state. Stiffness control was extended to a multiple-degree-of-freedom soft robot using MPC. Controlling stiffness of a 4-DOF arm reduced the end-effector deflection by approximately 50% (from 17.9 to 12.2cm) with a 4 lb (1.8 kg) step input applied at the end effector when higher joint stiffness (40 Nm/rad) was used compared with low stiffness (30 Nm/rad). This work shows that the derived stiffness model can enable effective position and stiffness control. © The Author(s) 2020.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Topic modeling is a common tool for understanding large bodies of text, but is typically provided as a Òtake it or leave itÓ proposition. Incorporating human knowledge in unsupervised learning is a promising approach to create high-quality topic models. Existing interactive systems and modeling algorithms support a wide range of refinement operations to express feedback. However, these systemsÕ interactions are primarily driven by algorithmic convenience, ignoring users who may lack expertise in topic modeling. To better understand how non-expert users understand, assess, and refine topics, we conducted two user studiesÑan in-person interview study and an online crowdsourced study. These studies demonstrate a disconnect between what non-expert users want and the complex, low-level operations that current interactive systems support. In particular, our findings include: (1) analysis of how non-expert users perceive topic models; (2) characterization of primary refinement operations expected by non-expert users and ordered by relative preference; (3) further evidence of the benefits of supporting users in directly refining a topic model; (4) design implications for future human-in-the-loop topic modeling interfaces. © 2017</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The paper proposes a power system state estimation algorithm in the presence of irregular sensor sampling and random communication delays. Our state estimator incorporates Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) and SCADA measurements. We use an Extended Kalman filter based algorithm for time alignment of measurements and state variables. Time stamps are assumed for PMU, SCADA and state estimation. Application of the proposed algorithm is illustrated for hourly/daily load/generation variations on two test examples: 14-bus and 118-bus. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Oxy-fired coal combustion is a promising potential carbon capture technology. Predictive CFD simulations are valuable tools in evaluating and deploying oxy-fuel and other carbon capture technologies either as retrofit technologies or for new construction. However, accurate predictive combustor simulations require physically realistic submodels with low computational requirements. A recent sensitivity analysis of a detailed char conversion model (Char Conversion Kinetics (CCK)) found thermal annealing to be an extremely sensitive submodel. In the present work, further analysis of the previous annealing model revealed significant disagreement with numerous data sets from experiments performed after that annealing model was developed. The annealing model was accordingly extended to reflect experimentally observed reactivity loss due to thermal annealing of a variety of coals in diverse char preparation conditions. The model extension was informed by a Bayesian calibration analysis. Additionally, because oxy-fuel conditions include extraordinarily high levels of CO2, development of a first-ever CO2 reactivity loss model due to annealing is presented.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This paper develops observers and controllers for relative estimation and circumnavigation of a moving ground target using bearing-only measurements or range with bearing measurements. A bearing-only observer, range with bearing observer, a general circumnavigation velocity command for an arbitrary aircraft, and nonlinear velocity-based multirotor controller are developed. The observers are designed in the body-fixed reference frame, while the velocity command and multirotor controller are developed in the body-level frame, independent of aircraft heading. This enables target circumnavigation in GPS-denied environments when only a camera-IMU estimator is used for state estimation and ensures observable conditions for the estimator. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the observers, velocity command, and multirotor controller under various target motions. © 2019 American Automatic Control Council.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Though academic research for identifying and considering the social impact of products is emerging, additional insights can be gained from engineers who design products every day. This paper explores current practices in industries used by design engineers to consider the social impact of products. Forty-six individuals from 34 different companies were interviewed to discover what disconnects exist between academia and industry when considering a product's social impact. These interviews were also used to discover how social impact might be considered in a design setting moving forward. This is not a study to find Òthe state of the art,Ó but considers the average engineering professional's work to design products in various industries. Social impact assessments (SIA) and social life cycle assessments (SLCA) are two of the most common processes discussed in the literature to evaluate social impact, both generally and in products. Interestingly, these processes did not arise in any discussion in interviews, despite respondents affirming that they do consider social impact in the product design. Processes used to predict social impact, rather than simply evaluate, were discussed by the respondents. These tended to be developed within the company and often related to industry imposed government regulations. To build on this study, the findings herein should be further validated for executives, managers, and engineers. A study specific to these roles should be designed to understand the disconnect better. Additionally, processes should be developed to assist engineers in considering the social impact of their products. Work should also be done to help educate engineers and their leaders on the value of considering the social impact in product design. Copyright © 2019 by ASME</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Though academic research for identifying and considering the social impact of products is emerging, the actual use of these processes in industry is undeclared in the literature. The gap between academic research and the industry adoption of these theories and methodologies can have real consequences. This paper explores current practices in industry that design engineers use to consider the social impact of products during the customer use stage. 30 people from nineteen different companies were interviewed to discover what disconnects exist between academia and industry when considering a productÕs social impact. Although social impact assessments (SIA) and social life cycle assessments (SLCA) are two of the most common evaluative processes discussed in the literature, not a single company interviewed used either of these processes despite affirming that they do consider social impact in product design. Predictive processes were discussed by the respondents that tended to be developed within the company and often related to government regulations. Copyright © 2018 ASME.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Background: This exploratory study uses multimodal approaches to explore undergraduate student engagement via topic emotions and electrodermal activity (EDA) in different engineering design method activities and with different instructional delivery formats (e.g., lecture vs. active learning). Purpose/Hypothesis: The goal of this research is to improve our understanding of how students respond, via engagement, to their engineering design activities during class. This study hypothesizes that students would experience no self-reported mean changes in topic emotions from their preassessment scores for each engineering design topic and instructional format nor would electrodermal activities (EDA) associate to these topic emotions throughout the design activities. Design/Method: Eighty-eight freshmen engineering students completed online pretopic and posttopic emotions surveys for five engineering design activities. A subset of 14Ð18 participants, the focal point of this study, wore an EDA sensor while completing the surveys and participating in these sessions. Results: Preliminary findings suggest that EDA increased for individual and collaborative active learning activities compared to lectures. No significant changes in EDA were found between individual and collaborative active learning activities. Moderate negative correlations were found between EDA and negative topic emotions in the first engineering design activity but not across the rest. At the end of the semester, active learning activities showed higher effect sizes indicating a re-enforcement of students' engagement in the engineering design method activities. Conclusion: This study provides initial results showing how multimodal approaches can help researchers understand students' closer-to-real-time engagement in engineering design topics and instructional delivery formats. © 2018 ASEE</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This paper presents a controller that uses relative range and bearing measurements to steer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to circular trajectories around a constant velocity target. Estimates of the range rate and angular rate to the target are used to improve the error in the range and bearing. For moving targets, their velocity is also estimated and used in the control law. Theoretical proofs using Lyapunov theory for stationary targets and feedback linearization for moving targets are provided. Numerical simulations show vehicles converging to circular formations around both stationary and moving targets. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Biosensors highjack and reengineer biological systems for highly specific detection of diverse molecules. However, many traditional biosensor devices have slow response times and high operating costs and require specialized training and immobile lab equipment. In an effort to address these limitations, researchers have begun using cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems as biosensors. CFPS-based systems provide the advantages of speed, portability, and robustness at a relatively low cost. Here, we review CFPS-based biosensors according to the three fundamental stages of CFPS: transcription, translation, and protein folding. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Subsea production control systems are instrumented to constantly monitor flowline pressure and temperature at key locations to prevent plugging and introduce mitigating control strategies. New fiber optic sensors with ruggedized construction and non-electrical components are subjected to accelerated aging tests and deployed in several installations with long service life. An overview of current progress with fiber optic technology is provided for fatigue monitoring, temperature, pressure, and strain sensing. Recent developments include improved service life, novel bonding methods, pipeline sensor station improvements, sensor calibration, and long-term fatigue analysis. The latest advancements are validated on multiple installations on a subsea tieback in the deepwater Mississippi Canyon of the Gulf of Mexico at 6, 500 ft depth. A prior third-party sensor design experienced multiple non-recoverable sensor failures. A new sensor station design is employed on two Flowline Terminations to monitor pressure and temperature at a rate of 100 Hz. Subsea tiebacks are susceptible to flow assurance issues caused by plugging events such as hydrate formation. The system was originally designed to track pig location but transitioned to pressure and temperature sensing. An issue with the transition was the lack of calibration relating the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) strain levels to the actual process conditions. A novel method is presented for in situ adjustment of the sensor array calibration. During the calibration procedure, the sensors produced unanticipated results during pipeline flow shut-in and later startup operations. The sensors helped uncover a configuration of the flowline and sensor locations that is valuable for detecting hydrate forming conditions at a key junction location. The sensors are located before and after the junction of two flowlines in the mixing zone of the pipeline streams. The novel contributions of this study are the high speed data collection, in situ fiber optic calibration, review of advancements in fiber optic sensing technology, and a field case study with multiple sensing arrays. The developments are part of the Clear Gulf study, a collaboration between the offshore energy industry and NASA that was formed in 2010. The objective of the Clear Gulf study is to employ space technology and testing facilities for use in the upstream industry to advance subsea sensor technology. The highly sensitive monitoring systems developed as part of this study are used to give early warnings for flow assurance issues, structural failures, or catastrophic events.

    <gf:abstract>This paper examines the problem of carrier phase and frequency estimation for coded 16-APSK in aeronautical mobile telemetry. Given the fact that coded systems tend to operate at lower signal-to-noise ratios than uncoded systems, the synchronizer must operate at these lower signal-to-noise ratios. For a 30 kHz frequency offset and a 10 Mbit/s 16-APSK signal, the conventional phase lock loop (PLL) system does not achieve consistent lock to be a useful approach. Consequently, a blind feed-forward approach, based on the FFT, and an initialized feedback approach based on the PLL were examined. The feed-forward estimator is capable of achieving BER ideal performance for Eb/N0 ³ 6 dB using 1024 symbols. The feedback estimator, initialized using a feed-forward estimate based on 1024 symbols is also capable of achieving BER ideal performance for Eb/N0 ³ 6 dB. Both synchronizers require a sufficiently good blind estimate: the estimate based on 2014 symbols appears to be the minimum value to achieve good performance. © 2019 International Foundation for Telemetering.

        <gf:abstract>One of the challenges of data mining is finding hyperparameters for a learning algorithm that will produce the best model for a given dataset. Hyperparameter optimization automates this process, but it can still take significant time. It has been found that hyperparameter optimization does not always result in induced models with significant improvement over default values, yet no systematic analysis of the role of hyperparameter optimization in machine learning has been conducted. We use metalearning to inform the decision of whether to optimize hyperparameters based on expected performance improvement and computational cost. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Jet noise consists of extended, partially correlated sources such that a single-wavepacket source representation is inadequate. A multiple-wavepacket (MWP) model provides an analytical framework for jet-noise-like radiation to simulate jet noise field levels as well as the corresponding spatial coherence properties within the field. Here, a beamforming method with regularization is applied to noise measured by a linear array near a high-performance military aircraft. Beamforming results are decomposed into a reduced-order MWP model and the predicted radiation is validated in terms of level and coherence properties using benchmark measurements. Sound levels and coherence lengths generated by the beamforming results show good agreement with benchmark measurements over a range of frequencies that contribute significantly to the overall radiation. The MWP model is shown to predict full-scale specific features such as multilobe directivity patterns, and the addition of an uncorrelated distribution (UD) model adequately predicts the sideline radiation that is otherwise difficult to reproduce from wavepacket radiation. The MWP model predicted radiation characteristics are an improvement over single-wavepacket models, which do not incorporate spatiotemporal features of the radiation. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

        <gf:abstract>Comparing whole genomes and finding variation is an important and difficult bioinfor-matic task. We present the Polygraph, a data structure for reference-free, multiple whole genome alignment that can be used to identify genomic structural variation. This data structure is built from assembled genomes and preserves the genomic structure from the assembly. It avoids the ÒhairballÓ graph structure that can occur in other graph methods such as de Bruijn graphs. The Polygraph can easily be visualized and be used for identification of structural variants. We apply the Polygraph to Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae for finding Structural Variants. Copyright © 2012-2020 easychair.org. All rights reserved.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>A sensitivity study testing the significance of particle size, scattering phase functions, and distribution in oxy-coal combustion was conducted. Literature review suggests that particle size and number density play a more critical role in determination of radiative properties than the complex index of refraction. Radiative data was produced from numerical experiments using one of two particle distribution profiles (narrow or wide). A comparison of highly forward scattering cases for two particle sizes (25_m vs. 75_m) revealed a significant difference in incident heat flux maximum (25%). This difference was observed in both profiles examined. It was also generally observed that as particle size increases the difference between incident heat flux for forward and backward scattering decreases. No significant difference was observed between the large diffuse sphere and no scattering cases, suggesting that accurate modelling of larger particle size distributions can be achieved while neglecting scattering and phase functions. This result agrees with current practice in industry for air - coal mixtures. However, data suggests that phase function/scattering coefficient influence becomes more and more important with increasingly fine particle size.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Organizations all over the world, both national and international, gather demographic data so that the progress of nations and peoples can be tracked. This data is often made available to the public in the form of aggregated national level data or individual responses (microdata). Product designers likewise conduct surveys to better understand their customer and create personas. Personas are archetypes of the individuals who will use, maintain, sell or otherwise be affected by the products created by designers. Personas help designers better understand the person the product is designed for. Unfortunately, the process of collecting customer information and creating personas is often a slow and expensive process. In this paper, we introduce a new method of creating personas, leveraging publicly available databanks of both aggregated national level and information on individuals in the population. A computational persona generator is introduced that creates a population of personas that mirrors a real population in terms of size and statistics. Realistic individual personas are filtered from this population for use in product development. © 2019 Design Society. All rights reserved.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This work presents on the hydrodynamics of water droplet impingement on superheated solid surfaces across the entire wettability spectrum: superhydrophilic, hydrophilic, hydrophobic and superhydrophobic. While a large body of work exists on droplet impingement on hydrophilic and superhydrophilic surfaces, impingement on the latter two has been largely neglected and the present results show that dynamics are dramatically different. Experiments ranging in surface temperature from 125¡C to 415¡C and Weber numbers from 10 to 225 were performed and analyzed using high-speed imaging. Some of the most striking differences are as follows. While atomization is always present for impingement on the hydrophilic and superhydrophilic surfaces at temperatures below the Leidenfrost point, atomization is absent at low Weber numbers and at low excess surface temperatures on the hydrophobic surface. At high surface temperatures, the attraction of vapor bubbles on the hydrophobic surface allows a vapor blanket to form more readily thus leading to Leidenfrost behavior at a much lower temperature than classically observed on a hydrophilic surface. One of the most interesting phenomenon that will be discussed includes what will be described as a Òpseudo-LeidenfrostÓ state for impingement on the superhydrophobic surface. Because water can be suspended at the peaks of the roughness on a superhydrophobic interface, vapor escapes from underneath the droplet thus mimicking Leidenfrost behavior for all excess temperatures. This results in minimal atomization for superhydrophobic impingement over the entire regime explored. Finally, maximum spread diameters for Leidenfrost impingement are tabulated as a function of the Weber number for all surfaces and are shown to be larger on the smooth surfaces than on the textured ones indicating that droplet spreading at the Leidenfrost point is not independent of surface type as previously supposed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Planar optofluidics provide a powerful tool for facilitating chip-scale light-matter interactions. Silicon-based liquid core waveguides have been shown to offer single molecule sensitivity for efficient detection of bioparticles. Recently, a PDMS based planar optofluidic platform was introduced that opens the way to rapid development and prototyping of unique structures, taking advantage of the positive attributes of silicon dioxide-based optofluidics and PDMS based microfluidics. Here, hydrodynamic focusing is integrated into a PDMS based optofluidic chip to enhance the detection of single H1N1 viruses on-chip. Chip-plane focusing is provided by a system of microfluidic channels to force the particles towards a region of high optical collection efficiency. Focusing is demonstrated and enhanced detection is quantified using fluorescent polystyrene beads where the coefficient of variation is found to decrease by a factor of 4 with the addition of hydrodynamic focusing. The mean signal amplitude of fluorescently tagged single H1N1 viruses is found to increase with the addition of focusing by a factor of 1.64. © 1995-2012 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>During large-scale disasters it is not uncommon for Public Safety Answering Points (e.g., 9-1-1) to encounter service disruptions or become overloaded due to call volume. As observed in the two past United States hurricane seasons, citizens are increasingly turning to social media whether as a consequence of their inability to reach 9-1-1, or as a preferential means of communications. Relying on past research that has examined social media use in disasters, combined with the practical knowledge of the first-hand disaster response experiences, this paper develops a knowledge-driven framework containing parameters useful in identifying patterns of shared information on social media when citizens need help. This effort explores the feasibility of determining differences, similarities, common themes, and time-specific discoveries of social media calls for help associated with hurricane evacuations. At a future date, validation of this framework will be demonstrated using datasets from multiple disasters. The results will lead to recommendations on how the framework can be modified to make it applicable as a generic disaster-type characterization tool. © 2019 Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management, ISCRAM.

    <gf:abstract>While the majority of jet noise analysis takes place with a static jet or aircraft, airbase and community military jet noise exposure happens for the most part when the aircraft is in flight. Comparisons between flyover and ground run-up measurements for high-performance military aircraft have not been previously published. This paper presents comparisons between static ground run-up and flyover measurements for the F-35 operating at 150% Engine Thrust Request. The overall sound pressure levels and spectra are shown for the two scenarios, as well as indicators of nonlinear propagation and shock content, specifically the derivative skewness and average steepening factor. The overall sound pressure level is reduced in the peak radiation direction aft of the aircraft but increased in the forward direction. The peak frequency of the noise is relatively unaffected by flight effects, though the amplitude of each frequency may vary. The increase in level in the forward direction results in shock formation that is absent during ground run-up measurements. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

        <gf:abstract>Two-factor authentication (2FA) defends against password compromise by a remote attacker. We surveyed 4,275 students, faculty, and staff at Brigham Young University to measure user sentiment about Duo 2FA one year after the university adopted it. The results were mixed. A majority of the participants felt more secure using Duo and felt it was easy to use. About half of all participants reported at least one instance of being locked out of their university account because of an inability to authenticate with Duo. We found that students and faculty generally had more negative perceptions of Duo than staff. The survey responses reveal some pain points for Duo users. In response, we offer recommendations that reduce the frequency of 2FA for users. We also suggest UI changes that draw more attention to 2FA methods that do not require WiFi, the 'Remember Me' setting, and the help utility. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Friction stir processing (FSP) was investigated as a method of repairing cracks in 12 mm thick 304L stainless steel plate. Healing feasibility was demonstrated by processing a tapered crack using a PCBN/W-Re tool with a 25 mm diameter shoulder and a pin length of 6.4 mm. The experiment showed that it was possible to heal a crack that begins narrow and then progressively grows up to a width of 2 mm. Bead on plate experiments were used to find the best parameters for creating a consolidated stir zone with the least amount of hardness difference compared to the base metal. Grain refinement in some specimens resulted in much higher stir zone hardness, compared to base metal. A plot of grain size versus microhardness showed a very strong inverse correlation between grain size and hardness, as expected from the Hall-Petch relationship. Corrosion testing was carried out in order to evaluate the effect of FSP on potential sensitization of the stir zone. After 1000 h of intermittent immersion in 3.5% saline solution at room temperature it was found that no corrosion products formed on the base material controls or on any of the friction stir processed specimens. © 2017</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This paper explains how we designed, developed and tested a locally sourced; environmentally sensitive, biodegradable collagen plastic. It discusses the creation of simple moulds for manufacturing tableware and the accompanying workshop proving the viability of both the process and product. Tests were conducted using commercially available collagen materials to understand its attributes. A unique formulation was developed from hides of local agricultural vermin and powders derived from invasive flora. Plaster and concrete moulds were created for the manufacture of simple tableware. A workshop occurred were 12 participants tested the quality of the plastic, the robustness of the moulds, the simplicity of the manufacturing process and the aesthetics of the tableware. Finally, four of the bowls were successfully tested for bio-degradability and fully degraded within 12 weeks of contact with soil. The workshop demonstrated the success of all aspects of the process and how this development process could be used in emerging communities globally to encourage local manufacture of sustainable products.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Two-factor authentication (2FA) significantly improves the security of password-based authentication. Recently, there has been increased interest in Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) security keys-small hardware devices that require users to press a button on the security key to authenticate. To examine the usability of security keys in non-enterprise usage, we conducted two user studies of the YubiKey, a popular line of U2F security keys. The first study tasked 31 participants with configuring a Windows, Google, and Facebook account to authenticate using a YubiKey. This study revealed problems with setup instructions and workflow including users locking themselves out of their operating system or thinking they had successfully enabled 2FA when they had not. In contrast, the second study had 25 participants use a YubiKey in their daily lives over a period of four weeks, revealing that participants generally enjoyed the experience. Conducting both a laboratory and longitudinal study yielded insights into the usability of security keys that would not have been evident from either study in isolation. Based on our analysis, we recommend standardizing the setup process, enabling verification of success, allowing shared accounts, integrating with operating systems, and preventing lockouts. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>The impact of twin transmission between neighboring grains as a contributor to overall twin activity is considered via a neighborhood viscoplastic self-consistent (NVPSC) model. The NVPSC model is an extension of a stochastic model for twin nucleation developed by Niezgoda et al. and a dislocation density based hardening law model developed by Knezevic et al. Beyond the baseline combined framework, the new model tracks sets of neighboring grains and allows twin transmission between them under certain conditions. The influence of grain boundary (GB) character is included in the stochastic models of twin nucleation and transmission. The starting texture from a rolled magnesium alloy AZ31B sheet was obtained using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) for initial input into the NVPSC. The sample was further deformed by uniaxial compression to encourage twin formation and the corresponding texture information was collected using EBSD. The accuracy of simulated twin activity was determined by comparing it with the twin activity seen in the deformed sample. The total number of predicted twins and the number of transmission twins is found to agree favorably with those observed via the EBSD scans. This validation demonstrates the significance of incorporating twin transmission as a twin formation mode in predictive models for this material. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Over the last two years our industrial design programme has been involved in a number of interdisciplinary team projects. We have observed that in successful teams, the education and skills of team members matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work and view their contributions. We believe that there are distinct and innate differences between students in different academic disciplines when it comes to moral positions and these differences in worldview inherently causes friction in interdisciplinary teams. Consequently, we feel that if students could understand these differences extrinsically, they could potentially improve their experience within their interdisciplinary team work. We ran a pilot study with students from Brigham Young University comparing the industrial design, engineering and entrepreneurship majors using The Moral Foundations Questionnaire (Graham, Haidt &amp; Nosek, 2008) This survey measures five facets of oneÕs moral position: Care/Harm, Fairness/Reciprocity, In-group/Loyalty, Authority/Respect and Sanctity/Purity. Results show that designers scored higher in liberal values than their more conservative leaning engineering and business student counterparts. These results support our hypothesis. Understanding the fundamental value differences between disciplinary training should reduce friction and enhance interdisciplinary team communication. This ability to appreciate other mindsets in order to communicate and effectively design with individuals from differing disciplines will be an Òessential skill for workers in the coming decadesÓ (Colombo and Grilli, 2005). © 2019 Institution of Engineering Designers, The Design Society.

        <gf:abstract>Carbon infiltrated carbon nanotubes (CI-CNT) are an important emerging material in several micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) because of their unique mechanical and chemical properties. While CI-CNTs are only roughly conductive they work well in micro springs, levers, and meshes. However, fabrication of CI-CNTs can result in large mechanical property variation, and methods to characterize properties usually involve destructive testing. Destructive testing also assumes the tested specimens are representative of the entire batch which is not always true in the case of CI-CNT production. Finding a non-destructive way to test for stiffness of this material reduces the number of parts that have to be made and increases confidence in the integrity of device being used. It also simplifies testing of complex parts. The stiffness of CI-CNT beams is related to the molecular structure of the carbon material infiltrated between the carbon nanotubes (CNTs), how it interacts with the CNTs, and how much of it there is. The amount of material can be approximated with the density of the beam, and both the type of material and its interaction with the CNTs can be approximated through analysis of the Raman spectra taken at the surface. A combination of these two observations can be related to the effective material stiffness. The relationship can be fitted with a power function, with a variance of 1.41 GPa, which is about 11% of the maximum stiffness of the samples tested. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Many applications of pre-trained language models use their learned internal representations, also known as word- or sentence embeddings, as input features for other language-based tasks. Over recent years, this has led to the implicit assumption that the quality of such embeddings is determined solely by their ability to facilitate transfer learning. In this position paper we argue that pre-trained linguistic embeddings have value above and beyond their utility as input features for downstream tasks. We adopt a paradigm in which they are instead treated as implicit knowledge repositories that can be used to solve common-sense reasoning problems via linear operations on embedded text. To validate this paradigm, we apply our methodology to tasks such as threat detection, emotional classification, and sentiment analysis, and demonstrate that linguistic embeddings show strong potential at solving such tasks directly, without the need for additional training. Motivated by these results, we advocate for empirical evaluations of language models that include vector-based reasoning tasks in addition to more traditional benchmarks, with the ultimate goal of facilitating language-based reasoning, or Ôreasoning in the linguistic domainÕ. We conclude by analyzing the structure of currently available embedding models and identifying several shortcomings which must be overcome in order to realize the full potential of this approach. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>A synthetic basis (SYBA) feature descriptor was used to perform frame-to-frame feature matching for frame differencing. The SYBAfeature descriptor is a robust algorithm that performs well with different degrees of image variation including: illumination, blurring, rotation, and perspective variations. The first step in detecting moving objects is to find the absolute difference between two image frames. To find the difference, the homography that describes the geometric relationship between the two frames is calculated using matched image feature points. The homography is then used to transform and align the images accurately. The transformed images are then used to calculate the absolute difference of the two images. It is then visually apparent where objects have moved or changed between the two images. Frame-to-frame object movement can be approximated to a linear process making the Kalman filter algorithm the best option. Once an object is lost, its corresponding track is deleted along with its corresponding motion model. During tracking, an object may be occluded by other objects in the scene. The MOT metric is designed to evaluate the performance of an object tracker by considering the tracking continuity, distance error for each path, and the reliability of detection. Thus, only the position of the object is considered in generating the MOT metric. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the method and prove that the SYBA descriptor works well with various image deformations.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Social Media contain a wealth of information that could improve the situational awareness of Emergency Managers during a crisis, but many barriers stand in the way. These include information overload, making it impossible to deal with the flood of raw posts, and lack of trust in unverified crowdsourced data. The purpose of this project is to build a communications bridge between emergency responders and technologists who can provide the advances needed to realize social media's full potential. We are employing a Delphi study survey design, which is a technique for exploring and developing consensus among a group of experts around a particular topic. Participants include emergency managers and technologists with experience in software to support the use of social media in crisis response, from many countries. The topics of the study are described and preliminary, partial results presented for Round 1 of the study, based on 33 responses. © 2019 Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management, ISCRAM.

        <gf:abstract>This work exploits the advantages of compliant mechanisms (devices that achieve their motion through the deflection of flexible members) to enable the creation of small instruments for minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Using flexures to achieve motion presents challenges, three of which are considered in this work. First, compliant mechanisms generally perform inadequately in compression. Second, for a 690 deg range of motion desired for each jaw, the bending stresses in the flexures are prohibitive considering materials used in current instruments. Third, for cables attached at fixed points on the mechanism, the mechanical advantage will vary considerably during actuation. Research results are presented that address these challenges using compliant mechanism principles as demonstrated in a two-degree-of-freedom (2DoF) L-Arm gripper. © 2017 by ASME.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>We present new families of thick origami mechanisms that achieve rigid foldability and parallel stacking of panels in the flat-folded state using linkages for some or all of the hinges between panels. A degree-four vertex results in a multi-loop eight-bar spatial mechanism that can be analyzed as separate linkages. The individual linkages are designed so that they introduce offsets perpendicular to the panels that are mutually compatible around each vertex. This family of mechanisms offers the unique combination of a planar unfolded state, parallel-stacked panels in the flat folded state, and kinematic single-degree-of-freedom motion from the flat-unfolded to the flat-folded state.

        <gf:abstract>Combined optimization of propulsion system design, flight trajectory planning and battery mass optimization for solar-regenerative high-altitude long endurance (SRHALE) aircraft through a sequential iterative approach yields an increase of 20.2% in the end-of-day energy available on the winter solstice at 35¡N latitude, resulting in an increase in flight time of 2.36 hours. The optimized flight path is obtained by using nonlinear model predictive control to solve flight and energy system dynamics over a 24 hour period with a 15 second time resolution. The optimization objective is to maximize the total energy in the system while flying a station-keeping mission, staying within a 3 km radius and above 60,000 ft. The propulsion system design optimization minimizes the total energy required to fly the optimal path. It uses a combination of blade element momentum theory, blade composite structures, empirical motor and motor controller mass data, as well as a first order motor performance model. The battery optimization seeks to optimally size the battery for a circular orbit. Fixed point iteration between these optimization frameworks yields a flight path and propulsion system that slightly decreases solar capture, but signif-icantly decreases power expended. Fully coupling the trajectory and design optimizations with this level of accuracy is infeasible with current computing resources. These efforts show the benefits of combining design and trajectory optimization to enable the feasibility of SRHALE flight. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

    <gf:abstract>For unmanned aircraft systems to gain full access to the National Airspace System, they must have the capability to detect and avoid other aircraft. To safely avoid another aircraft, an unmanned aircraft must detect the intruder aircraft with ample time and distance to allow the ownship to track the intruder, perform risk assessment, plan an avoidance path, and execute the maneuver. This paper describes two analytical methods for finding the minimum detection range to ensure that these detection and avoidance steps can be carried out. The first method, time-based geometric velocity vectors, includes the bank-angle dynamics of the ownship; whereas the second, geometric velocity vectors, assumes an instantaneous bank-angle maneuver. The solution using the first method must be found numerically, whereas the second has a closed-form analytical solution. These methods are compared to two existing methods. The results show the time-based geometric velocity vectors approach is precise, the geometric velocity vectors approach is a good approximation under many conditions, and the two existing approaches are good approximations at large ownship speeds relative to the intruder speed, fast ownship bank-angle transients, and small ownship bank angles.

    <gf:abstract>Decellularized porcine kidneys were recellularized with renal epithelial cells by three methods: perfusion through the vasculature under high pressure, perfusion through the ureter under high pressure, or perfusion through the ureter under moderate vacuum. Histology, scanning electron microscopy, confocal microscopy, and magnetic resonance imaging were used to assess vasculature preservation and the distribution of cells throughout the kidneys. Cells were detected in the magnetic resonance imaging by labeling them with iron oxide. Perfusion of cells through the ureter under moderate vacuum (40 mmHg) produced the most uniform distribution of cells throughout the kidneys. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>The Synchronized-offset-rolling-contact element (SORCE) technique for thickness accommodation in origami-inspired mechanisms combines selected strengths of several thickness-accomadation techniques but with the tradeoff of manufacturing complexity of rolling joints. This work presents principles to facilitate the construction of rolling joints suitable for applications like the SORCE technique. These include leveraging fold-angle multipliers of origami vertices, variations of flexure assembly, sunken flexures, and form-closed rolling joints. Prototypes of origami-mechanisms using the SORCE technique are constructed demonstrating these principles. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The drilling industry has substantially improved performance based on knowledge from physics-based, statistical, and empirical models of components and systems. However, most models and source code have been recreated multiple times, which requires significant effort and energy with little additional benefit or step-wise improvements. The authors propose that it is time to form a coalition of industry and academic leaders to support an open source effort for drilling, to encourage the reuse of continuously improving models and coding efforts. The vision for this guiding coalition is to 1) set up a repository for source code, data, benchmarks, and documentation, 2) encourage good coding practices, 3) review and comment on the models and data submitted, 4) test, use and improve the code, 5) propose and collect anonymized real data, 6) attract talent and support to the effort, and 7) mentor those getting started. Those interested to add their time and talent to the cause may publish their results through peer-reviewed literature. Several online meetings are planned to create this coalition, establish a charter, and layout the guiding principles. Multiple support avenues are proposed to sustain the effort such as: annual user group meetings, create a SPE Technical Section, and initiating a Joint Industry Program (JIP). The Open Porous Media Initiative is just one example of how this could be organized and maintained. As a starting point, this paper reviews existing published drilling models and highlights the similarities and differences for commonly used drillstring hydraulics, dynamics, directional, and bit-rock interaction models. The key requirements for re-usability of the models and code are: 1) The model itself must be available as open source, well documented with the objective and expected outcomes, include commented code, and shared in a publicly available repository which can be updated, 2) A user's guide must include how to run the core software, how to extend software capabilities, i.e., plug in new features or elements, 3) Include a "theory" manual to explain the fundamental principles, the base equations, any assumptions, and the known limitations, 4) Data examples and formatting requirements to cover a diversity of drilling operations, and 5) Test cases to benchmark the performance and output of different proposed models. In May 2018 at "The 4th International Colloquium on Non-linear dynamics and control of deep drilling systems," the keynote question was, "Is it time to start using open source models?" The answer is "yes". Modeling the drilling process is done to help drill a round, ledge free hole, without patterns, with minimum vibration, minimum unplanned dog legs, that reaches all geological targets, in one run per section, and in the least time possible. An open source repository for drilling will speed up the rate of learning and automation efforts to achieve this goal throughout the entire well execution workflow, including planning, BHA design, real-time operations, and post well analysis.

    <gf:abstract>In this paper the problem of performing a precision landing of an autonomous multirotor on a small barge at sea is studied. An image-based visual servoing approach, which was initially developed for landing on stationary targets, is extended to suit the shipboard landing case. The approach includes visual servoing for aligning the multirotor with a target on the vessel, and a velocity feed-forward term which is estimated online by fusing vision and GPS velocity measurements. Special considerations are made to account for the presence of wind, and the approach is validated through full-scale outdoor hardware flight tests. The hardware system is composed entirely from off-the-shelf components that are commonly used in industry. © 2019 American Automatic Control Council.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>To further understand the unique characteristics of military aircraft noise, the sound field in the vicinity of a tied-down F-35B was measured for various engine powers, from 25% to 150% Engine Thrust Request (ETR). Synchronous measurements along a linear ground array approximately parallel to the shear layer were used to image the entire field through multisource statistically optimized near-field acoustical holography (M-SONAH). The field in the direction of maximum radiation consists of multiple lobes in the spatiospectral domain, which are manifest as multiple local maxima in space for a fixed frequency or multiple peaks in the spectra at a fixed location. Multiple lobes are observed at non-afterburning and afterburning engine conditions. As frequency increases for a given engine power, lobes appear towards the sideline and shift aft until they disappear beyond the measurement aperture and new lobe(s) take their place. As engine power is increased at a fixed frequency, the forwardmost lobe increases in its relative contribution to the field, which is a major contributing factor to the forward shift in overall directivity with increasing engine power. Field reconstructions and data in the forward direction outside of the region of maximum radiation show the presence of broadband shock-associated noise (BBSAN) for 75% ETR and above. Reconstructions along the nozzle lipline of the jet indicate the BBSAN originates from approximately the same region as the sources for the main radiation direction. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

    <gf:abstract>This study reports a collection of surveyed responses from industrial design students at Brigham Young University over six semesters regarding high levels of perceived stress in a competitive class environment, and it outlines playful interventions in coursework and classroom settings to measure if play can make any significant impact on studentsÕ perceptions of stress and feelings of frustration. This study is inspired by existing play studies that continue to demonstrate the positive relationship between the freedom to be playful and psychological wellbeing. The methods used in this study include a consolidation of 99 anonymous free-response student surveys over the course of six semesters that are organised in terms of stress level and frustration word indicators. These comments provide a historical baseline for understanding the student perceptions of their classroom learning experience as it relates to their emotional wellbeing. We then compare those comments with comments made after a semester of playful interventions to discover how they differ. The results indicate that levels of ÒstressÓ and ÒfrustrationÓ were decreased with playful interventions, however students spent more hours outside of class lecture on their assignments and the overall student course rating nominally decreased. These results are discussed as well as how pedagogical changes to traditional classroom environments such as this may not only impact stress and frustration but also significantly contribute to the holistic learning experience for university students. © 2019 Institution of Engineering Designers, The Design Society.

        <gf:abstract>Periodically patterned superhydrophobic surfaces with rectangular rib and circular post arrays were utilized as heat transfer surfaces in a boiling apparatus with the water pool undergoing saturated pool boiling. The surface microstructures were geometrically defined by cavity fraction (the ratio of projected cavity area to surface area), pitch (the center to center distance between microfeatures), and feature height. Surface heat flux and surface superheat, the difference between the heated surface and the pool saturation temperature, were measured for each surface. Ten different micropatterned surfaces with post or rib geometries were considered with cavity fraction varying from 0.5 to 0.98, pitch varying from 8 to 40 _m, and microfeature height at 4 _m or 15 _m. The surface heat flux was measured across a range of surface superheats spanning 2Ð38 K. It is demonstrated for the first time that the transition from nucleate boiling to film boiling on rib patterned surfaces depends strongly on the cavity fraction. Increasing the microstructure height from 4 _m to 15 _m modestly increases the transition temperature. Nucleate boiling is more suppressed on post patterned surfaces than on rib patterned surfaces. Further, the rib structured surfaces exhibit a sudden transition from nucleate to film boiling while the post structured surfaces exhibit a gradual transition, with the vapor film growing slowly across the surface. Once stable film boiling is reached, the surface microstructure negligibly influences the heat flux for all surfaces. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>We analyze numerically the behavior of a deformable micro-capsule confined in a pipe under a pulsatile flow. The capsule moves and is deformed by the action of a pulsatile flow inside the tube with a non-null mean velocity. This configuration can be found in the nature and in many bioengineering systems where artificial capsules are driven by micro-pumps through micro-channels. The capsule is considered as a thin hyperelastic membrane, which encloses an internal fluid. As it has been demonstrated in the literature, this model represents a wide range of artificial capsules, for example, the alginate-based capsules, typically used in bioengineering applications. A hybrid isogeometric finite element method and boundary element method based on a T-spline discretization and formulated in the time domain is used to solve the mechanical and hydrodynamical equations. The influence of the relative rigidity of the membrane, frequency and amplitude of the pulsatile flow is studied. Results show that the behavior of the capsule differs from steady flows and it depends strongly on the frequency of the flow and mechanical characteristic of the capsule. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The initial phases of the design process Ð including interactions with stakeholders, ideation of concept candidates, and the selection of the best candidates Ð have a large impact on the success of a project as a whole. They also tend to be the most unstructured portion of the project, and are often marginalized by teams who assume they already understand stakeholder needs and the best solution paths to pursue. Design researchers have developed methods shown to increase the creativity and divergent thinking of the design team during these initial phases of design. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on only a vague or amorphous representation of the design space (the set of all possible concepts the design team could feasibly select to meet the objective of the project). In this paper, we introduce a particular design-space structure that can help teams ideate and evaluate their ideation, thus improving the early phases of the design process. The design space presented here is a vector space with a basis of technology (the physical product people will use) and tactics (the procedure for using the product). Also presented are definitions, principles, and sub-theories that facilitate the creation and use of technology-tactics plots to represent the design space. Considering the design space in this structured way, the design team can gain valuable insights that improve the effectiveness of the initial stages of design, and may yield additional benefits to the design process as a whole, if further developed.

    <gf:abstract>In the past few years, there have been some significant advances in consumer virtual reality (VR) devices. Devices such as the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Leap Motionª Controller, and Microsoft Kinect¨ are bringing immersive VR experiences into the homes of consumers with much lower cost and space requirements than previous generations of VR hardware. These new devices are also lowering the barrier to entry for VR engineering applications. Past research has suggested that there are significant opportunities for using VR during design tasks to improve results and reduce development time. This work reviews the latest generation of VR hardware and reviews research studying VR in the design process. Additionally, this work extracts the major themes from the reviews and discusses how the latest technology and research may affect the engineering design process. We conclude that these new devices have the potential to significantly improve portions of the design process. Copyright © 2017 by ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>When a rigid body collides with a liquid surface with sufficient velocity, it creates a splash curtain above the surface and entrains air behind the sphere, creating a cavity below the surface. While cavity dynamics has been studied for over a century, this work focuses on the water entry characteristics of deformable elastomeric spheres, which has not been studied. Upon free surface impact, an elastomeric sphere deforms significantly, giving rise to large-scale material oscillations within the sphere resulting in unique nested cavities. We study these phenomena experimentally with high-speed imaging and image processing techniques. The water entry behaviour of deformable spheres differs from rigid spheres because of the pronounced deformation caused at impact as well as the subsequent material vibration. Our results show that this deformation and vibration can be predicted from material properties and impact conditions. Additionally, by accounting for the sphere deformation in an effective diameter term, we recover previously reported characteristics for time to cavity pinch off and hydrodynamic force coefficients for rigid spheres. Our results also show that velocity change over the first oscillation period scales with the dimensionless ratio of material shear modulus to impact hydrodynamic pressure. Therefore, we are able to describe the water entry characteristics of deformable spheres in terms of material properties and impact conditions. © 2017 Cambridge University Presså.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The macro-to-micro interface method presented here meets many of the requirements for an ideal interconnect by sealing a short length of plastic tubing directly to a microfluidic chip. The adaptability and low-temperature processing make it compatible with a wide range of device materials. The method was validated on silicon, acrylic (polymethyl methacrylate), printed circuit board and glass substrates with high-pressure integrity to over 300 psi (2 MPa). Fluid interfaces created with this method were used for pressure tests on microfluidic channels constructed on silicon. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>The dynamic cone penetration test (DPT) developed in China has been correlated with liquefaction resistance in gravelly soils based on field performance data from the Mw7.9 Wenchuan, China earthquake. The DPT consists of a 74 mm diameter cone tip driven by a 120 kg hammer with a free fall height of 1 m. To expand the data base, DPT soundings were performed at the Pence Ranch and Larter Ranch sites where gravelly soil liquefied during the 1983 Mw6.9 Borah Peak earthquake. DPT testing was performed using an automatic hammer with the energy specified in the Chinese standard and with an SPT hammer. In general, comparisons suggest that standard energy corrections developed for the SPT can be used for the DPT. The DPT correctly predicted liquefaction and non-liquefaction at these two test sites. Liquefaction resistance from the DPT (30% probability) also correlated reasonably well with that from Becker penetration testing (BPT).

    <gf:abstract>Additive manufacturing allows for fabrication of highly complex structures that efficiently use a 3D volume of space. Current state of the art metal additive manufacturing methods such as Selective Laser Melting (SLM) allow for intricate parts with high mechanical strength but at the cost of increased surface roughness on internal faces of waveguide structures. This paper investigates the contribution to loss of the increased surface roughness on a set of SLM WR42 waveguides printed with a standard ALSi10Mg aluminum powder, and compares their attenuation performance to purchased single-piece WR42 waveguides and to an industry-standard method for CNC machining waveguide multi-piece assemblies. Single-piece construction of RF parts produces lower attenuation than multi-piece assembly, and lower surface roughness directly leads to lower attenuation, as expected. SLM RF waveguides had better part consistency and comparable or better attenuation performance compared to CNC waveguides, showing that this manu-facturing method has reached the point where it can be used in RF waveguide assemblies. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The paper explores the effects of sensor behavior and communication system (CS) irregularities on power system state estimation (SE). CS are modeled in Network Simulator 2 (NS-2), allowing the quantification of irregularities, including delays and dropped packets. The overall information is obtained combining SCADA measurements with phasor measurement unit (PMU) derived data, where time stamping (based on GPS or an equivalent local clock) for all measurements is assumed. To fully analyze the effects of irregularities, a detailed analysis of sensitivities to different communication system parameters is provided as well. Using the co-simulation environment PiccSIM, a SE with these irregularities is quantified for CS parameter variation, with detailed models of power and communication flows. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>In human-swarm systems, human input to a robot swarm can both inhibit desirable swarm behaviors and allow the operator to properly guide the swarm to achieve mission goals. Indeed, the way that control is shared between the human operator and the inherent collective robot behaviors determines in large part the success of the human-swarm system. In this paper, we seek to understand how to design human-swarm systems that effectively moderate human influence over a robot swarm. To do this, we implement a simulated swarm system based on honeybees, and study how interacting with this swarm using various methods of moderating human influence impacts the success of the resulting human-swarm system. Our results demonstrate that moderating human influence is essential to achieving effective human-swarm systems, and highlight the need for future work in determining how to better moderate human influence in human-swarm systems. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>In a flipped classroom model, learning of basic content is shifted before class while in-class time is used for concept application. Empirical and controlled research studies are lacking on the best strategies to provide the necessary pre-class content instruction. In this study, we tested three methods of pre-class content learningÑinteractive online tutorials, video lectures, and textbook-style readingsÑwhile holding the content and the in-class application activities constant. Identical introductory, non-majors biology classes were manipulated at both a public, open-enrollment institution and a private, highly selective institution. We found that video lectures offer a small advantage to overall student learning over interactive tutorials or textbook-style readings. Although our two populations differed in their ability to effectively learn from pre-class activities, through a student-centered flipped classroom approach, students at both institutions demonstrated equal learning gains by the final assessment. Potential reasons for some observed differences are suggested. © 2018, The Author(s).</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Recent developments in electric aircraft technology have enabled the use of distributed propulsion for the next generation of vertical lift vehicles. However, the ability to rapidly assess the performance of these design concepts, with sufficient fidelity, is a current weakness of this nascent industry. This paper explores the capacity of the viscous Vortex Particle Method (VPM) to model wake interactions found in distributed propulsion. The elements of the vortex particle method are summarized, and a new approach for the calculation of vortex stretching through the complex-step derivative approximation is presented. Preliminary validation is performed on vortex ring cases resembling the fundamental dynamics encountered in propeller wakes. Unsteady wake dynamics of individual propellers are successfully modeled, replicating the instabilities that lead to vortex breakdown as observed experimentally. Comparing the method with results from momentum theory, it is shown that VPM is consistent with theoretical values of near and far field induced velocities, and a notable feature is its ability to model near/far field transition. Furthermore, VPM is able to fully characterize induced velocities across the entire wake, from the stable region where momentum theory operates, through instability transition and eventual vortex breakdown. The simulation of a multirotor configuration of two tip-to-tip propellers is shown, displaying the capacity of VPM to model wake mixing. The results presented here are intermediate steps in the development of a mid-fidelity modeling tool for the early design stages of distributed-propulsion electric aircraft. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

        <gf:abstract>A real-time visual multiple target tracker is demonstrated onboard a descending multirotor. Measurements of moving ground targets are generated using the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) tracking method. Homography-based image registration is used to align the measurements into the same coordinate frame, allowing for the detection of independently moving objects. The recently developed Recursive-RANSAC algorithm uses the visual measurements to estimate targets in clutter. Altitude-dependent tuning increases track continuity and coverage during the descent of the vehicle. The algorithm requires no operator interaction and increases the situation awareness of the unmanned aerial system. Real-time tracking efficiency is analyzed on GPUs and CPUs. Tracking results are presented and discussed using the MOTA and MOTP metrics. © 2018 AACC.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Changes in running strike pattern affect ankle and knee mechanics, but little is known about the influence of strike pattern on the joints distal to the ankle. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of forefoot strike (FFS) and rearfoot strike (RFS) running patterns on foot kinematics and kinetics, from the perspectives of the midtarsal locking theory and the windlass mechanism. Per the midtarsal locking theory, we hypothesized that the ankle would be more inverted in early stance when using a FFS, resulting in decreased midtarsal joint excursions and increased dynamic stiffness. Associated with a more engaged windlass mechanism, we hypothesized that a FFS would elicit increased metatarsophalangeal joint excursions and negative work in late stance. Eighteen healthy female runners ran overground with both FFS and RFS patterns. Instrumented motion capture and a validated multi-segment foot model were used to analyze midtarsal and metatarsophalangeal joint kinematics and kinetics. During early stance in FFS the ankle was more inverted, with concurrently decreased midtarsal eversion (p &lt; 0.001) and abduction excursions (p = 0.003) but increased dorsiflexion excursion (p = 0.005). Dynamic midtarsal stiffness did not differ (p = 0.761). During late stance in FFS, metatarsophalangeal extension was increased (p = 0.009), with concurrently increased negative work (p &lt; 0.001). In addition, there was simultaneously increased midtarsal positive work (p &lt; 0.001), suggesting enhanced power transfer in FFS. Clear evidence for the presence of midtarsal locking was not observed in either strike pattern during running. However, the windlass mechanism appeared to be engaged to a greater extent during FFS. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Many multiple target tracking algorithms operate in the local frame of the sensor and have difficulty with track reallocation when targets move in and out of the sensor field of view. This poses a problem when an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is tracking multiple ground targets on a road network larger than its field of view. We propose a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) to maintain individual target tracks and to perform probabilistic data association when the targets are constrained to a road network. This is particularly useful when a target leaves then re-enters the UAV's field of view. The RBPF is structured as a particle filter of particle filters. The top level filter handles data association and each of its particles maintains a bank of particle filters to handle target tracking. The tracking particle filters incorporate both positive and negative information when a measurement is received. We then implement a receding horizon controller to improve the filter certainty of multiple target locations. The controller prioritizes searching for targets based on the entropy of each target's estimate. © 2019 American Automatic Control Council.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>A novel thickness-accommodation technique for origami based mechanisms is introduced. This technique modifies a zerothickness pattern by splitting each vertex along the minor folds into a system of two vertices. The modified fold pattern then has thickness applied to it and the resulting mechanism is kinematically equivalent to the modified fold pattern. Origami patterns that are rigid-foldable and only have two panels that stack between folds are utilized in the technique. The technique produces thick origami mechanisms where all panels lie in a plane in the unfolded state without any holes or protrusions and maintain a single degree of freedom. Steps for synthesizing split-vertex mechanisms are presented and examples of split-vertex mechanisms are shown. Advantages and potential applications of the technique are discussed.

        <gf:abstract>Codon bias, the usage patterns of synonymous codons for encoding a protein sequence as nucleotides, is a biological phenomenon that is not fully understood. Several methods exist to represent the codon bias of an organism: codon adaptation index (CAI) [1], individual codon usage (ICU), hidden stop codons (HSC) [2] and codon context (CC) [3]. These methods are often employed in the optimization of heterologous gene expression to increase the accuracy and rate of translation. They, however, have many shortcomings as they dont take into account the local and global context of a gene. We present a method for modeling global and local codon bias through deep language models that is more robust than current methods by providing more contextual information and long-range dependencies. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>The compliance and other nonlinear dynamics of large-scale soft robots makes effective control difficult. This is especially true when working with unknown payloads or when the system dynamics change over time which is likely to happen for soft robots. In this paper, we present a novel method of coupling model reference adaptive control (MRAC) with model predictive control (MPC) for platforms with antagonistic pneumatic actuators. We demonstrate its utility on a fully inflatable, six degreeof-freedom pneumatically actuated soft robot manipulator that is over two meters long. Specifically, we compare control performance with no integral controller, with an integral controller, and with MRAC when running a nominal model predictive controller with significant weight attached to the end effector. © 2019 ASME.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The search for an equivalent acoustic source model for high-speed jet noise has recently focused on wavepacket representations. A wavepacket is defined as a spatially extended source with an axial amplitude distribution that grows, saturates and decays, an axial phase relationship that produces directional noise, and correlation lengths longer than the integral length scales of the turbulent structures. This definition of a wavepacket has the same characteristics as the large-scale turbulent mixing noise; if the turbulent mixing noise can be isolated, the associate equivalent acoustic wavepacketÑdefined as a pressure fluctuation on a cylinder around the jet nozzleÑcan be found. An estimate of the frequencydependent, spatial variation in the large-scale turbulent mixing noise comes from a similarity spectra decomposition of the measured autospectral density, which in turn leads to data-educed wavenumber axial spectra associated with the frequency-dependent equivalent wavepackets. This wavepacket eduction technique has been applied to acoustical measurements of an unheated, Mach 1.8 jet in the near and far fields. At both locations, the resulting frequency-dependent, data-educed wavenumber spectra exhibit different types of self-similarity for low and high frequency regimes that become apparent when the axial wavenumber is scaled by the acoustic wavenumber, with a transition band between the two regimes. As expected, the data-educed wavenumber spectra can be used to predict field levels in the dominant radiation lobe. Addition of an uncorrelated source distribution, derived from the similarity spectra decomposition associated with the fine-scale turbulent mixing noise, creates a model that accounts for the sideline levels. This field-prediction ability of the wavepacket-plus-uncorrelated-distribution model is tested using the near and far field measurements. When predicting the field at the other location, the modelÕs average error is less than 2 dB for St = 0.04-0.25 but increases for larger St because the apparent directivity changes from near to far field, likely due to the frequency dependence of the extended source region. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

    <gf:abstract>In the past decade, there have been increasing efforts and initiatives to increase participation in computer science worldwide. In the U.S., these efforts have resulted in national curricula and increased local expectations. The research on actual implementation often reports on efforts of single schools or districts. This paper provides a high-level description of the practices and challenges of teaching CS in K-12 across an entire state. To better understand how these efforts might increase CS education for all, we surveyed every public school in the state of Utah and analyzed enrollment data for all 19 Utah CS courses. The survey consisted of closed and open-ended questions about each school's current CS practices and personnel. Schools from 39 of 42 public school districts responded (including charter schools) representing 46.3% of the state's high schools, 39.3% of middle/junior high schools, and 28% of elementary schools. Course data indicated that enrollment in CS courses increased considerably in the past five years after the introduction of newer, more fundamental courses. Despite the general enrollment increase, there has been a markedly smaller increase in student enrollment in more advanced CS courses. In this paper, we discuss these and other surprising results, as well as challenges that educators reported in promoting and teaching CS. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This paper presents a practical physical-layer security scheme based on coding methodologies combined with self-jamming to combat advantaged eavesdroppers, i.e., eavesdroppers that may possess an equal or even better channel than the legitimate receiver. We introduce a strengthened security gap notion, where reliability is assured by typical bit-error rate (BER) measurements, but secrecy is guaranteed by considering the entire distribution of messages upon reception, instead of average measures. Relying on this new security gap notion, we then propose a scheme that combines concatenated coding with self-jamming by the legitimate receiver for effective security and reliability even when eavesdroppers possess a channel with equal or better conditions than the legitimate receiver. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>We present kleuren, a novel assembly-free method to reconstruct phylogenetic trees using the Colored de Bruijn Graph. kleuren works by constructing the Colored de Bruijn Graph and then traversing it, finding bubble structures in the graph that provide phylogenetic signal. The bubbles are then aligned and concatenated to form a supermatrix, from which a phylogenetic tree is inferred. We introduce the algorithms that kleuren uses to accomplish this task, and show its performance on reconstructing the phylogenetic tree of 12 Drosophila species. kleuren reconstructed the established phylogenetic tree accurately, and is a viable tool for phylogenetic tree reconstruction using whole genome sequences.

    <gf:abstract>This paper describes the fabrication and testing of a system to inject DNA into plant leaves. Arrays of silicon lances were made using photolithographic and STS DRIE Bosch techniques. A nanoinjector device was also made to accept the silicon lance arrays and perform nanoinjections. Nanoinjections were performed on Arabidopsis and cotton cotyledons. Changes in the force applied during a nanoinjection and varying the number of repeated nanoinjections on the same cotyledon were observed. Too much force or too many repeated injections caused physical damage to the cotyledon. An optimal force and number of repeated injections can be performed without causing physical damage to the cotyledon. Several injections using DNA were performed without successful transfection of the leaves. Possible reasons for this failure to transfect were explored. Copyright © 2019 ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Visual style transfer involves combining the content of one image with the style of another, and recent work has produced some compelling results. This paper proposes a related task that requires additional system intelligence and autonomy-that of style creation. Rather than using the style of an existing source image, the goal is to have the system autonomously create a rendering style based on a simple (text-based) semantic description. Results demonstrate the system's ability to autonomously create interesting, semantically appropriate styles that can be applied for image rendering. © 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

    <gf:abstract>FENICS (Flame Equilibrium Numeric Iterative Calculation Software) is a code developed to be a fast running tool for use in designing axisymmetric, oxy-coal furnaces. The code calculates gas temperature and composition, wall heat flux, and wall and refractory temperatures using 1D, equilibrium chemistry and a 3D discrete ordinates radiation solver. Chemistry and temperature calculations are made for a discrete number of axial zones wherein the temperature and species composition are assumed to be uniform. Radiation calculations are performed on a finer grid and assume gray gases. The code was validated by comparing to experimental data obtained from the L1500 Multifuel Furnace. The experimental data were taken from a single oxy-coal combustion experiment with flue gas recirculation run at a firing rate of 880kW and an air-fuel ratio of 3.6. FENICS was able to qualitatively match the wall flux and temperature profiles quite well. The major exception to this being that peak flux cannot accurately be predicted due the assumptions utilized 'smearing' the flame. Quantitatively, FENICS showed good agreement with the data. Wall temperatures were accurate to within 150K (13%) while total wall radiative heat loss was within 4%. FENICS was also used to evaluate temperatue and flux profiles for a new pilot-scale oxy-coal reactor.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This work evaluated the influence of compressive strength and confinement on the stress-strain behavior of axial loaded mortar specimens by means of experimental and numerical analyses. Two mortars were tested, with volume proportions of cement, lime and sand of 1:0.5:4 and 1:1:6. Two specimen heights, 50 and 140 mm, with diameter of 45 mm, resulting in diameter/height ratios of 1.0 and 0.3, respectively were used. The experimental results indicated that the confinement and strength of the mortar influence its stress-strain behavior: the larger the confinement, the more the non-linear behavior. In addition, the results indicated that the Poisson's ratio and the tangent modulus of elasticity vary with increasing applied load. A numerical model was developed that accounted for the observations from the experimental phase with a nonlinear elastic phased analysis, which updates the modulus of elasticity and the Poisson's ratio at each new phase. The tangent modulus of elasticity was calculated directly from the experimental results while the Poisson's ratio was approximated using the model proposed by Ottosen. The numerical model presented satisfactory results, even close to the failure, when cracking is significant. © 2018 The International Masonry Society (IMS).</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Design students return from field trips abroad brimming with new ideas and a greater understanding of their chosen discipline. However, if their observations and knowledge are not soon applied, the students hold only fond memories of a fun trip abroad. We believe that studentÕs retention and application of concepts will increase if educators give students greater autonomy on the trip and also expect and enable opportunities to apply their accrued knowledge on their own projects upon returning home. Nine third and fourth-year industrial design students Brigham Young University participated in a weeklong field study abroad to Dutch Design Week (DDW) in Eindhoven, Netherlands. A week after the completion of the study abroad the students filled out a survey about their motivations, feelings, criticisms, and aspects of the trip that influenced them as designers. Three and a half months later the students took a second survey asking about how they have applied insights gained from participation in DDW to their current projects. The results from the both surveys suggest the impact of the field study trip decreased over time. The observations and more open-ended questions in the survey helped determine if and how the students applied their conceptual knowledge to their current projects as well as other outcomes of the trip. In addition, the paper suggests possible strategies and research opportunities for future field study experiences. © 2018 Institution of Engineering Designers The Design Society.

        <gf:abstract>Multimode interference (MMI) waveguides can be used for multiplexing and de-multiplexing optical signals. High fidelity, wavelength dependent multi-spot patterns from MMI waveguides are useful for sensitive and simultaneous identification of multiple targets in multiplexed fluorescence optofluidic biosensors. Through experiments and simulation, this paper explores design parameters for an MMI rib anti-resonant reflecting optical waveguide in order to produce high fidelity spot patterns at the liquid core biomarker excitation region. Width and etch depth of the single excitation rib waveguide used to excite the MMI waveguide are especially critical because they determine the size of the input optical mode which is imaged at the MMI waveguide's output. To increase optical throughput into the MMI waveguide when light is coupled in from an optical fiber, tapers in the waveguide width can be used for better mode matching. © 2012 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This paper presents an analytical investigation of thermal transport due to a steady, laminar, axisymmetric liquid jet impinging normally on a superhydrophobic (SHPo) surface maintained at constant surface temperature. At the liquid-surface boundary of the spreading thin film, an isotropic hydrodynamic slip and temperature jump are imposed to approximate the SHPo surface boundary condition. Applying an integral analysis within the thin film results in a system of differential equations which are solved numerically to obtain local hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layer thicknesses, thin film height, and local and radially averaged heat flux. The classical smooth hydrophobic scenario with no-slip and no-temperature jump showed excellent agreement with previous differential analysis of the same problem. The influence of varying temperature jump length on the local Nusselt number was obtained over a range of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. Increasing temperature jump length results in a dramatic decrease in the local thermal transport near the impingement point. The greatest decrease occurs at small temperature jump lengths. Further, local and average Nusselt numbers are less influenced by the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers as temperature jump length increases. Overall, variations in the temperature jump length exert much more influence than variations in the hydrodynamic slip length. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Recent experiences (e.g. New Zealand and United States) show that blast tests can cause liquefaction, inducing undrained cyclic loading, generating excess pore water pressure, and consequently producing real deformations. This paper introduces the results obtained from a research project on blast induced liquefaction, performed at a trial site located in Mirabello (near Ferrara, Italy), a little village strongly affected by liquefaction during the 2012 Emilia-Romagna earthquake. The liquefiable soils in this area contained significantly more fines than in previous blast tests. In particular, the objectives of the experiment were: (i) to evaluate liquefaction induced settlement of Apennine silts and sands, and Po River sands; (ii) to determine downdrag forces on pile foundations; (iii) to measure change in shear wave velocity/shear modulus with excess pore pressure; and (iv) to measure change in soil properties with time after liquefaction. This paper illustrates the results acquired before, during, and after the blast test using in-situ tests, pore pressure transducers, profilometers, topographical surveys, and a test micropile instrumented with strain gauges. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Over the past few years, the Utah Department of Transportation has developed the signal performance metrics (SPMs) system to evaluate the performance of signalized intersections dynamically. This system currently provides data summaries for several performance measures, one of them being turning movement counts collected by microwave sensors. As this system became public, there was a need to evaluate the accuracy of the data placed on the SPMs. A large-scale data collection was carried out to meet this need. Vehicles in the Hi-resolution data from microwave sensors were matched with the vehicles by ground-truth volume count data. Matching vehicles from the microwave sensor data and the ground-truth data manually collected required significant effort. A spreadsheet-based data analysis procedure was developed to carry out the task. A mixed model analysis of variance was used to analyze the effects of the factors considered on turning volume count accuracy. The analysis found that approach volume level and number of approach lanes would have significant effect on the accuracy of turning volume counts but the location of the sensors did not significantly affect the accuracy of turning volume counts. In addition, it was found that the location of lanes in relation to the sensor did not significantly affect the accuracy of lane-by-lane volume counts. This indicated that accuracy analysis could be performed by using total approach volumes without comparing specific turning counts, that is, left-turn, through and right-turn movements. In general, the accuracy of approach volume counts collected by microwave sensors were within the margin of error that traffic engineers could accept. The procedure taken to perform the analysis and a summary of accuracy of volume counts for the factor combinations considered are presented in this paper. © 2017 The Authors</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Low-head dams are capable of creating dangerous countercurrents just downstream from the structure. These dangerous countercurrents are known as submerged hydraulic jumps and are responsible for hundreds of fatalities at numerous low-head dams across the United States. The countercurrent creates high upstream-directed surface velocities across the width of the channel, making it nearly impossible for a trapped individual to escape. This submerged jump can occur for a range of upstream and downstream conditions. A multiple partial width deflector design for the downstream side of the dam was tested in the laboratory to determine effectiveness in completely or partially eliminating the submerged hydraulic jump. The results demonstrate that a dramatic reduction in upstream-directed surface velocities over a wide range of headwater and tailwater conditions is possible. The dam modification is relatively inexpensive, simple to install, and designed such that an individual will likely escape the submerged jump without severe injury or harm. The design is ready for prototype testing. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Various solutions to visual multi-target tracking have been proposed, but many of them are not capable of running in real time from a moving camera on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We present a tracker that runs in real time and tracks multiple objects while accounting for camera motion on a UAV. Our algorithm is capable of processing over 10 frames per second on a 1280x720 video sequence. We utilize Recursive-RANSAC, an efficient algorithm for tracking multiple objects in clutter. Our work combines motion detection with optical flow and feature matching to allow stationary objects to be tracked. We use a feature prioritization algorithm to reduce computational complexity and spatial redundancy. We also present a ghost track reduction method which prevents tracking non-existent objects when true objects are no longer visible. We demonstrate the performance of our tracker on a moving camera video sequence. Video results are available at https://youtu.be/6bXjKb-6qY. © 2018 AACC.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The design and testing of an origami-based bellows for microgravity drilling is described. The potential benefits of an origami-based solution created an opportunity for application on NASAÕs Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) to protect sensitive parts from debris. Origami-based bellows were designed to fit spatial limitations and meet needed compression ratios. Designs have demonstrated high mass reductions, improved stroke length, greatly decreased stowed volume, improved flexibility, and reduced reaction forces in comparison with traditional metal bellows. A nylon-reinforced polyvinyl fluoride based bellows with an aramid fiber stitched seam is well suited for debris containment in space conditions. Various epoxies maintained an adequate bond with polyvinyl fluoride below expected environmental temperature for bellows mounting. Asymmetric compression of the bellows occurs at extreme low temperatures and is preventable by balancing stiffness within the structure. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

        <gf:abstract>Human remote-control (RC) pilots have the ability to perceive the position and orientation of an aircraft using only third-person-perspective visual sensing. While novice pilots often struggle when learning to control RC aircraft, they can sense the orientation of the aircraft with relative ease. In this paper, we hypothesize and demonstrate that deep learning methods can be used to mimic the human ability to perceive the orientation of an aircraft from monocular imagery. This work uses a neural network to directly sense the aircraft attitude. The network is combined with more conventional image processing methods for visual tracking of the aircraft. The aircraft track and attitude measurements from the convolutional neural network (CNN) are combined in a particle filter that provides a complete state estimate of the aircraft. The network topology, training, and testing results are presented as well as filter development and results. The proposed method was tested in simulation and hardware flight demonstrations. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>We present several new properties of curved-fold mechanisms, those with smoothly curved surfaces joined by sharp curved folds. After describing curved folds and various relationships among their geometric properties, we show that there is an important class, uniform folds, that is particularly well suited to low-degree-of-freedom mechanisms. There is a natural discretization algorithm for uniform curved folds; we present this algorithm and show discretized example mechanisms. Copyright © 2017 ASME.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Demineralized bone matrix (DBM) is an excellent bone scaffold material, but is available in only limited sizes. An additive manufacturing (AM) method that retains these properties while enabling customized geometry fabrication would provide bone scaffolds for a larger range of geometries while maintaining the benefits of DBM. This work examines laser sintering (LS) of a blend of demineralized bone matrix (DBM) and polycaprolactone (PCL) using a CO2 laser beam. A comprehensive experimental study was carried out to find the conditions that form defect-free layers while still retaining the favorable biological features of DBM. The results identify a process setting window over which LS can be utilized to constructing complex patient-specific scaffolds. With the identified setting, first, the DBM/PCL blend was fused in the LS machine. Parts were then were further strengthened through a post-processing heat treatment. The shrinkage level, skeletal density, mechanical testing, and porosimetry of the resultant samples were compared to traditional machined DBM blocks. The maximum tensile strength of the samples and post-processing shrinkage depends on heat treatment duration. The tensile strength measurements demonstrate that the post-processing conditions can be tuned to achieve the tensile strength of the demineralized bone strips. Evaluation of the dimensional change suggests that the shrinkage along the laser paths is ~0.3% while thickness shrinks the most (up to ~20%). The porosimetry and density studies showed that the final part achieved over 40% porosity with a density comparable to blocks of DBM. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

        <gf:abstract>FleCSPH1 is a complement of the FleCSI framework, focusing on tree data structures with support for binary, quad and octrees. The framework provides parallel, distributed and accelerated tree construction and search in the context of multi-physics problems. FleCSI2 is a compile-Time configurable framework designed to support multi-physics applications and is developed and maintained by the Los Alamos National Laboratory. FleCSI provides domain scientists with a set of data structures and tools to target parallel and distributed architectures on current and future supercomputers, including the ongoing 2020 target to support the first Exascale supercomputers. Our work on FleCSPH is based on a specific method that emphasizes different walls in HPC called Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). This method can be efficiently solved using binary, quad and octrees while providing irregularities in terms of computation and communications. This paper is decomposed as follows: The introduction describes the SPH method and the reasons that makes it a good test case for the FleCSPH framework. We give more details on the FleCSI framework; The second part is dedicated to the tree data structure itself and the choices we made for the domain decomposition, the tree construction and search. We also describe our distribution strategies and their reliability to the FleCSI model; The third part describes our test cases and the current results of the application. The test cases are the Sod shock tube, the Sedov blast and 2D/3D fluid flows. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Many parties to the construction process have implemented lean construction practices to improve efficiency within their respective scopes of work. Academics have researched a wide range of these applications in an effort to assess barriers, benefits, and other associated impacts. One area of construction that is currently under-represented in lean literature is finishing contractors. The purpose of this paper was to assess lean implementation by finishing contractors in the US. 33% of the sample of contractors specializing in the finishing methods reported implementation of some level of lean practices. For those attempting lean, the most common tool being utilized was Last Planner System. The same group reported that implementation was driven by a desire to improve efficiency by cutting costs and reducing schedules. Non-practicing respondents indicated that the primary barrier to implementation was a lack of knowledge in the area.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Previous investigation into cuteness literature resulted in a preliminary, three-factor model for defining and organizing information regarding taste terms. A theoretical definition of a taste term should have a declaration of: 1) aesthetic purpose, 2) the essential emotional responses, and 3) understandable themes and expressions. A small group of second-year industrial design students explored the model, and was tasked with identifying, defining, and experimenting with three taste terms of their choosing: Performance, Strength, and Simple Quiet. To test their knowledge, they applied their aesthetic insights to a simple industrial design problem. Even though the original intent was to explore and define concepts of taste, and expand visual and verbal vocabulary for students, it was anecdotally observed that this exercise had a positive effect on creative output. This article will summarize the results of their efforts, and offer suggestions for future work regarding understanding the more granular context of taste terms. © Common Ground Research Networks, Richard Fry, All Rights Reserved.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Multidimensional terahertz (THz) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for understanding nonlinear excitation, coherent energy flow, and coupling between collective degrees of freedom on ultrafast time scales. With extreme vibrational excitation using high-field THz light, 2D THz spectroscopy can reveal how anharmonic mode coupling results in coherent energy transfer and ascertain the excitation pathways behind nonlinear sample responses. We directly compare 2D THz-THz transmission measurements to 2D THz-THz-Raman measurements and explore evidence of anharmonic coupling between phonon modes in _-barium borate. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>The Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) began collecting asset management data using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology in 2012, which included horizontal curve data. However, its horizontal curve data were highly segmented and not ready for crash prediction model development for curve segments. In 2014, an algorithm named the horizontal alignment finder (HAF) algorithm was developed to identify horizontal curves on rural two-lane two-way highways. Its accuracy was about 85 percent with 2012 data. The HAF was recently recalibrated for all other types of UDOT's highways and found to be applicable to them without any modifications in its main algorithm. During the calibration, six types of errors were identified. Four of the six errors were fixed and the HAF was calibrated with new 2015 LiDAR data. The improved HAF's accuracy now ranges from 97 to 98 percent for curve length and 87 to 100 percent for curve location identification. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Design space exploration (DSE) is the process whereby a designer seeks to understand some results across a set of design variations. Structural DSE of turbomachinery compressor blades is often challenging because the large number of design variables make it difficult to learn the effect that each variable has upon the stress contours. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the stress contours is used as a way to understand how the stress contours change over the design space. Two methods are introduced to address the challenge of understanding how the stress changes over a large number of variables. First, a two-point correlation is applied to relate the design variables to the scores of each principal component. Second, a coupling of the stress and coordinate location of each node in PCA is developed which also indicates how the stress variations relate to geometric variations. These provide insight to how design variables influence the stress. It is shown how these methods use PCA as DSE tools to better explore the structural design space of compressor blades. Better DSE can improve compressor blades and the computational cost needed for their design. Copyright © 2020 by ASME</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This article is a part of a more general study which aims to determine the most relevant engineering gas radiative property models to be applied in the simulations of combustion problems. Two versions of the full-spectrum CK (FSCK) model, the Rank-Correlated full-spectrum kdistribution/ Spectral-Line-Weighted-sum-of-gray-gases (RC FSK/SLW) and a new version of the Weighted-Sum-of-Grey-Gases (WSGG) model are compared with the Narrow-Band CK (NBCK) model in four turbulent axisymmetric jet diffusion flames fueled either by hydrogen or methane at atmospheric and higher pressures. As a first step, these comparisons are performed in decoupled radiative heat transfer calculations with the thermal fields being prescribed. The databases and coefficients associated to these different models are determined from a unique Line-By-Line database in order to allow a relevant comparison. Model results suggest that the SLW/FSK methods coupled to the Cai's scheme (JQSRT 141 (2014) 65-92) or the Rank-Correlated spectrum (JQSRT 214 (2018) 120-32) and databases generated from accurate LBL database are the most mature gas radiative property models to be implemented in CFD code dealing with combustion problems involving complex geometry and gas-soot mixtures. © Begell House Inc. 2020.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Additive manufacturing with conductive materials enables new approaches to printed electronics that are unachievable by standard electronics manufacturing processes. In particular, electronics can be embedded directly into structural components in nearly arbitrary 3D space. While these methods incorporate many of the same materials, the new processing methods require standard test methods to compare materials, processing conditions, and determine design limits. This work demonstrates a test method to quantitatively measure the adhesion failure of printed inks deposited on a substrate without changing the ink printing conditions. The proposed method is an adaption of single lap shear testing in which the lap joint is created by bonding the second substrate to the ink after curing. It was found that the interfacial shear strengths are independent of the adhesives used to attach cured conductive ink to the second substrate. In addition, chemical surface treatments of flame and plasma and mechanical sand-blasting increase the interfacial shear strengths by ~25% and 80%, respectively, while altering the adhesive failure mode to cohesive failure for most cases. This work also shows extruded substrates with undulated features increase adhesion strength; therefore, in addition to surface treatments, the geometric freedom of additive manufacturing (AM) could be leveraged to design surface features for enhanced adhesion. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>The formation of soot in power-boiler systems can have a significant impact on boiler performance due to direct effects on local flame temperatures and wall heat flux. In this work, a soot model was developed for coal systems that accommodates differences between solid fuel systems and gaseous systems, for which most traditional soot models are developed. The developed soot model contains terms for: particle nucleation based on tar evolution in a coal system, a nucle-ation mechanism based on the formation of PAH from gaseous species, gaseous interactions with particles (including: surface growth through HACA, particle oxidation/gasification), coagulation, and aggregation of existing particles. A monodispersed-particle size distribution form of this model can be used for cost-effective simulations, or for simulations with higher fidelity, the method of moments is used to transport higher moments of the particle size distribution. Validation work is presented, comparing numerically-derived soot values from the proposed model against measured soot concentrations in a flat-flame burner. © 2017 Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute.

    <gf:abstract>Lithium-ion battery modeling for use in battery management systems requires models that can adapt to the changing behavior of a cell as it ages. One method to enable this adaptivity is to select the most representative model from a set of Òpre-agedÓ models that represent the characteristics of the cell as different cyclic and calendar aging processes occur. By modeling the aging of a cell as a Markovian process, an interacting multiple-model Kalman filter (IMM) can be utilized to determine a time-varying probability mass function that specifies the probability that each of the models under consideration is the best representation of the cell under observation. While the output of the IMM is useful by itself, its predictions can be improved by post-processing. In this paper, we present methods to analyze the time-series probability mass function produced by the IMM using the Viterbi and BCJR algorithms in common use in the digital-communications discipline. These algorithms seek to identify the Òbest pathÓ through the space of available models over time, based on the likelihoods produced by the IMM and the Markovian transition probabilities. Through the use of these post-processing algorithms, confidence in the best-fitting model can be improved. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Rayleigh-Bnard convection (RBC) and Taylor-Couette flow (TCF) are two paradigmatic fluid dynamical systems frequently discussed together because of their many similarities despite their different geometries and forcing. Often these analogies require approximations, but in the limit of large radii where TCF becomes rotating plane Couette flow (RPC) exact relations can be established. When the flows are restricted to two spatial independent variables, there is an exact specification that maps the three velocity components in RPC to the two velocity components and one temperature field in RBC. Using this, we deduce several relations between both flows: (i) heat and angular momentum transport differ by, explaining why angular momentum transport is not symmetric around even though the relation between, the Rayleigh number, and, a non-dimensional measure of the rotation, has this symmetry. This relationship leads to a predicted value of that maximizes the angular momentum transport that agrees remarkably well with existing numerical simulations of the full three-dimensional system. (ii) One variable in both flows satisfies a maximum principle, i.e. the fields' extrema occur at the walls. Accordingly, backflow events in shear flow cannot occur in this quasi two-dimensional setting. (iii) For free-slip boundary conditions on the axial and radial velocity components, previous rigorous analysis for RBC implies that the azimuthal momentum transport in RPC is bounded from above by, where is the shear Reynolds number, with a scaling exponent smaller than the anticipated. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

    <gf:abstract>The strain on a single FBG sensor, integrated into a single layer of Kevlar mounted behind a Kevlar soft body armor coupon, is measured throughout a ballistic impact event. The strain is collected through high-speed, full-spectral interrogation of the FBG during the event. The use of the wavelength shift and spectral distortion of the FBG provides a description of the strain profile and interaction between the optical fiber and Kevlar fabric. The measurements are correlated to high-speed camera images taken from the rear and side of the armor coupon. In future testing, this information can be applied to identify the sequence of energy dissipation mechanisms enacted within the armor to resist the ballistic impact. © OSA 2018 © 2018 The Author(s)</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Tubular origami may provide both the needed deployment displacement and sufficient strength to be useful as deployable structures. This paper reviews origami tube-based deployable mechanisms and a structural optimization of FEA models is performed. Symmetric and non-symmetric 4-sided tubes are evaluated. Panel geometries and thicknesses are varied to produce rigidly foldable origami-tube-based mechanisms that are both strong and lightweight. The mechanical properties of these tubes over various deployment lengths are discussed. Three different configurations of this mechanism are compared and the advantages of each are discussed.

    <gf:abstract>Two-factor authentication (2FA) defends against account compromise. An account secured with 2FA typically requires an individual to authenticate using something they know-typically a password-as well as something they have, such as a cell phone or hardware token. Many 2FA methods in widespread use today have not been subjected to adequate usability testing. Furthermore, previous 2FA usability research is difficult to compare due to widely-varying contexts across different studies. We conducted a two-week, between-subjects usability study of five common 2FA methods with 72 participants, collecting both quantitative and qualitative data. Participants logged into a simulated banking website nearly every day using 2FA and completed an assigned task. Participants generally gave high marks to the methods studied, and many expressed an interest in using 2FA to provide more security for their sensitive online accounts. We also conducted a within-subjects laboratory study with 30 participants to assess the general usability of the setup procedure for the five methods. While a few participants experienced difficulty setting up a hardware token and a one-time password, in general, users found the methods easy to set up. © is held by the author/owner.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Solar-Regenerative High-Altitude Long-Endurance (SR-HALE) aircraft are designed to sustain year-round ight at high altitudes indefinitely. No SR-HALE aircraft has yet accomplished this task due to the complex network of environmental, solar, structural, and aerodynamic trade-offs, among which aircraft exibility plays a key role. A comprehensive SR-HALE aircraft multidisciplinary design optimization framework is developed in which the exible aircraft analysis tool ASWING is incorporated in order to constrain nonlinear aeroelasticity. Energy, battery, ply thickness, material failure, local buckling, aerodynamic stall, longitudinal stability, and general stability (including utter) constraints are applied in order to reasonably constrain the optimized SR-HALE aircraft design. An SR-HALE aircraft design with a span length of 60:15m and a total aircraft weight of 432:2 kg is found which fulfills all SR-HALE mission requirements and minimizes aircraft mass. A further 21% reduction in total aircraft mass is found through the use of high modulus carbon fiber reinforced polymer. Significant decreases in aircraft mass, down to a total aircraft mass of 250.6 kg, are found to be possible if altitude requirements for SR-HALE aircraft are lowered from 18;288m to 16;764 m. A feasible SR-HALE aircraft with a mass of 357:9 kg was also found to be possible if battery specific energies of 360Wh kgÐ1 are developed. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

    <gf:abstract>Lamina emergent compliant mechanisms (including origami-adapted compliant mechanisms) are mechanical devices that can be fabricated from a planar material (a lamina) and have motion that emerges out of the fabrication plane. Lamina emergent compliant mechanisms often exhibit undesirable parasitic motions due to the planar fabrication constraint. This work introduces a type of lamina emergent torsion (LET) joint that reduces parasitic motions of lamina emergent mechanisms, and presents equations for modeling parasitic motion of LET joints. The membrane joint also makes possible one-way joints that can ensure origami-based mechanisms emerge from their flat state (a change point) into the desired configuration. Membrane-enhanced LET (M-LET) joints, including one-way surrogate folds, are described here and show promise for use in a wide range of compliant mechanisms and origami-based compliant mechanisms. They are demonstrated as individual joints and in mechanisms such as a kaleidocycle (a 6R Bricard linkage), degree-4 origami vertices (spherical mechanisms), and waterbomb base mechanisms (an 8R multi-degrees-of-freedom origami-based mechanism). © 2018 by ASME.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>For an adequate understanding of the broadband acoustic phenomena generated by a rocket exhaust jet impinging on a flame deflector, this study experimentally clarifies the factors that cause the difference in the broadband acoustic field of a supersonic ideally expanded jet impinging on an inclined flat plate for various nozzleÐplate distances. According to previous studies, there are two possible factors: the Mach waves, which are radiated from the free-jet region and reflected by the plate, and the acoustic waves generated in the impingement region. To distinguish the effects of these factors, this study compares the following three results: the overall sound pressure level distribution, images extracted from the schlieren visualization movies using acoustic-triggered conditional sampling, and tracing lines of the acoustic intensity vectors of the Mach waves. The results reveal that the nozzleÐplate distance affects the fraction of the Mach waves that are generated in the free-jet region and reflected by the plate, resulting in a higher overall sound pressure level in the upstream direction for larger nozzleÐplate distances. It is concluded that the location of the plate relative to the source region of the Mach waves significantly affects the acoustic phenomena, owing to the variation in the nozzleÐplate distances.

        <gf:abstract>In this paper we present a starting point for designing for and/or assessing the social impact of engineered products. The starting point is a set of tables comprising products, their general functional characteristics, and the accompanying social impacts. We have constructed these tables by first extracting a set of social impact categories from the literature, then 65 products were qualitatively reviewed to find their social impact. The resulting product impact tables can be used at either the beginning of the product development process to decide what social impact to design for and discover product functions that lead to it, or later to qualitatively assess the social impact of a product being designed and/or to assess the impact of an existing product. © 2017 ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This study has examined the impact of cell type and mesh refinement on predicted combustion results. Mesh refinement in regions of high velocity gradients was shown to be the most critical factor in achieving realistic simulation results. In Case 5 where mesh refinement was focused near the geometric shapes of the cooling tubes and burner tile, insufficient mesh refinement existed in the fuel-air mixing zones around and above the burner to accurately predict fuel jet penetration and fuel-air mixing, resulting in inaccurate predictions for flame shape and heat flux profiles at the cooling tubes. Differences in predicted incident flux, total heat transfer and flame shape between the highest levels of mesh refinement (~2 million cells) between the structured trimmed-cell mesh and the unstructured polyhedral mesh were minimal. At lower mesh levels of 1 million cells, there were slightly greater discrepancies between the structured trimmed-cell mesh and the unstructured polyhedral mesh, particularly with respect to the flame shape and upper furnace flux profile predicted in Case 3. Interestingly, the differences in thermal efficiency and total heat transfer were greater between Case 2 and Case 1 (2 million versus 1 million cells) than between Case 2 and Case 5 (2 million versus 1 million cells with poor refinement). This trend was also observed with Case 4 and Case 3. This suggests both cell count and local mesh refinement are important to achieving accurate combustion predictions, but that there is minimal difference between the results with differing mesh types as long as the cell count and refinement are sufficient to represent the expected jet mixing behavior. These results also suggest that while the flame shape does impact the boundary flux profile as expected, the impact on thermal efficiency may be less well correlated. Thus, total heat transfer results should not be used to assess flame shape behavior; boundary flux profiles provided better correlation to flame shape.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Flushing a vacuum-assisted toilet generates noise levels that can be disturbing both to users and those nearby. Peak radiated noise levels correlate with the time when the valve opens and closes, while the noise levels when the valve is completely open are also relatively high. Significant noise ranges between 300 Hz and 3000 Hz. It was hypothesized that increasing the in-tube distance between the flush valve and the bowl in addition to increasing the bend radius of the tube would reduce radiated noise levels. These modifications resulted in a reduction of about 14 dB in the radiated noise during the valve opening and closing in addition to a reduction of about 5 dB while the valve is completely opened. Intermediate results of varying the tube length and bend radius are presented to show their effects on the radiated sound levels. Two tube inserts were designed to fit (1) underneath and (2) behind the toilet in a compact manner. They were tested to show that they maintain noise control performance without modifying any other part of the toilet. © 2020 Institute of Noise Control Engineering. © 2020 Institute of Noise Control Engineering.

        <gf:abstract>Dry-stack masonry systems are constructed without mortar between the blocks. This reduces the cost of specialty laborers and the variability in construction that exists from the application of mortar. Several dry-stack systems exist and can be subcategorized as interlocking systems or surface bonded systems. In interlocking systems, the blocks are connected by their geometry while in surface bonded systems the blocks are connected by a structural coating applied to the surface of the wall. This article describes a finite element model that can be used to predict the in-plane capacity and behavior of dry-stack masonry walls with a surface coating. Four walls were built and tested for their in-plane shear capacity. Two walls were unreinforced and ungrouted and two walls were reinforced and grouted at 1.22 m both vertically and horizontally. The results of these tests were used to validate the finite element model. The finite element model was developed using VecTor2. The numerical response is in good agreement to measured response. For the ungrouted unreinforced walls, the calculated maximum load was within 4% and 14% of the measured maximum loads. For the reinforced and grouted walls, the calculated maximum load was within 8% and 1% of the measured maximum loads. © 2018 The International Masonry Society (IMS).</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>While vertical takeoff and landing aircraft have shown promise for urban air transport, distributed electric propulsion on existing aircraft may offer immediately implementable alternatives. Distributed electric propulsion could potentially decrease takeoff distances enough to enable thousands of potential intercity runways. This conceptual study explores the effects of a retrofit of open-bladed electric propulsion units. To model and explore the design space, blade element momentum method, vortex lattice method, linear-beam finite element analysis, classical laminate theory, composite failure, empirically based blade noise modeling, motor and motor-controller mass models, and gradient-based optimization are used. With liftoff time of seconds and the safe total field length for this aircraft type undefined, this paper focused on the minimum conceptual takeoff distance. It was found that 16 propellers could reduce the takeoff distance by over 50% compared with the optimal 2-propeller case. This resulted in a conceptual minimum takeoff distance of 20.5 m to clear a 50 ft (15.24 m) obstacle. It was also found that, when decreasing the allowable noise by approximately 10 dBa, the 8-propeller case performed the best with a 43% reduction in takeoff distance compared with the optimal 2-propeller case. This resulted in a noise-restricted conceptual minimum takeoff distance of 95 m. Copyright © 2019 by Kevin R. Moore and Andrew Ning.

    <gf:abstract>Modeling soot formed from solid complex fuels such as coal or biomass is difficult and rare in the combustion community. Previously a detailed model was developed for soot formation depicting the soot particle size distribution using the method of moments with interpolative closure. This model is both accurate and complex. Computational expense of this model may be beyond many large-scale simulations. As a result, a simplified version of this detailed model has been developed. This simplified model makes two easy assumptions to drastically reduce the complexity of modeling soot formation. First assumption is that soot particles and soot precursors within a computational domain are assumed to be mono-dispersed, meaning all particles are the same size. This reduces the number of resolved terms to model both soot precursors and soot particles to three resolved terms rather than the 10+ terms required by the previously developed model. Second assumption is that all particles are spherical. While the simplified model is computationally less expensive, these two assumptions come with a cost in accuracy. Presented is both the development of this simplified model along with comparative simulations where the complex and simple models are ran. From these simulations, researchers and developers can justify which model may be used in their respective systems. © 2018 Western States Section/Combustion Institute.

    <gf:abstract>This study investigated the potential of delivering an anti-glaucoma drug using commercial silicone hydrogel (SiHy) contact lenses. The moderately hydrophobic drug latanoprost was rapidly loaded in 4 min by swelling contact lenses in a solution of the drug in n-propanol. A fraction of the drug was radiolabeled, thus allowing measurement of the uptake and subsequent release of drug into artificial tear fluid. Three questions were addressed: (1) how much drug can be loaded into each type of lens, (2) how fast is drug release, and (3) how are these values related to the contact lens chemistry. The results showed that much more latanoprost could be loaded into SiHy lenses than a conventional contact lens of poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate). The drug uptake correlated with the amount of swelling in n-propanol, with Galyfilcon lenses having the greatest swelling and highest drug uptake. The drug release from the SiHy lenses occurred over days, whereas the conventional lens released nearly all drug in a burst over a few hours. To examine correlations between lens chemistry, drug chemistry and uptake, and solvent chemistry, the Hansen solubility parameters were calculated using estimates of contact lens chemistry. These results showed that drug uptake in SiHy lenses correlated with favorable solubility parameter interactions between the n-propanol and the lens material, but did not correlate with interactions between the drug and the lens materials. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Conventional wastewater treatment systems demand a high cost mechanical aeration. Using algal-bacterial systems helps to reach a cost-efficient treatment method by eliminating mechanical aeration, since algae produce the oxygen needed for treatment process. In this study, two groups of experiments were performed for domestic wastewater treatment processes. For the first group, semi-continuous microalgae-bacterial photo-bioreactors were cultivated. Chlorella Vulgaris and activated sludge (AS) were used as microalgae and bacterial inoculums, respectively. The effect of different algae and AS ratios on the chemical oxygen demand (COD), N-NH4 + and P-PO4 3_ removal was studied. The removal efficiency of COD was above 93 % for the three tested algae and AS inoculum ratios (5:1, 1:1, and 1:5). The reactor with algae: AS inoculum ratio of 5:1 achieved the highest final N-NH4 + and P-PO4 3_ removal efficiencies (88.0 ± 1.0 % and 84.0 ± 1.0 %, respectively). Furthermore, the highest biomass concentration (1.96 g L-1 from initial amount of 0.3 g L-1) was observed in the reactor with algae: AS ratio of 5:1. The ratio of 5:1 (algae: AS) was found as the optimum ratio which promoted the cooperation between microalgae and AS for nutrient removal. For the second group of experiments, the optimum ratio of 5:1 (algae: AS) was used in a membrane bioreactor, and the results showed that this reactor enhanced the final removal efficacies from 88 to 98 % and from 84 to 89 % for N-NH4 + and P-PO4 3-, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>We study the spectral stability of roll wave solutions of the viscous St. Venant equations modeling inclined shallow water flow, both at onset in the small Froude number or Òweakly unstableÓ limit F_ 2 + and for general values of the Froude number F, including the limit F_ + °. In the former, F_ 2 +, limit, the shallow water equations are formally approximated by a Korteweg-de Vries/KuramotoÐSivashinsky (KdVÐKS) equation that is a singular perturbation of the standard Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation modeling horizontal shallow water flow. Our main analytical result is to rigorously validate this formal limit, showing that stability as F_ 2 + is equivalent to stability of the corresponding KdVÐKS waves in the KdV limit. Together with recent results obtained for KdVÐKS by JohnsonÐNobleÐRodriguesÐZumbrun and Barker, this gives not only the first rigorous verification of stability for any single viscous St. Venant roll wave, but a complete classification of stability in the weakly unstable limit. In the remainder of the paper, we investigate numerically and analytically the evolution of the stability diagram as Froude number increases to infinity. Notably, we find transition at around F= 2.3 from weakly unstable to different, large-F behavior, with stability determined by simple power-law relations. The latter stability criteria are potentially useful in hydraulic engineering applications, for which typically 2.5 ² F² 6.0. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>At its core, engineering and similar disciplines rely strongly on technical innovation to design and develop creative solutions to complex problems. However, for novice engineering students, conceptualizing engineering design activities is not an easy task. To do so, they must overcome cognitive blocks to facilitate unique and adequate engineering design solutions. This effect may be compounded when engineering design projects centered around service learning are introduced. The intent of this study was to explore if and what types of conceptual blocks may be present among novice engineering students when design heuristic cues are provided in the classroom. Findings suggest that using classroom interventions around design heuristic, students had a difficult time "shaking off" their conceptual blocks to the design solution. Primarily, communicative and perceptual blocks were found to predominate among novice engineering student groups. © 2018 TEMPUS Publications.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The theory of cognitive modes states that individuals have unique and dominant ways of receiving, processing, and using information and that these styles influence behaviors and abilities. These abilities are natural talents. Every profession uses different. The work someone is most likely to enjoy and be successful in is work that uses his or her specific abilities. Research identifies three dominant cognitive modes for industrial designers: creative thinking, visual thinking, and adaptive thinking. This paper describes a series of experiences developed to help assess creative, visual, and adaptive thinking in students that are considering the industrial design program at Brigham Young University. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This paper describes a manifold learning algorithm for big data classification and parameter identification in real-time operation of power systems. We assume a black-box setting, where only SCADA-based measurements at the point of interest are available. Data classification is based on diffusion maps, where an improved data-informed metric construction for partition trees is used. Data reduction is demonstrated on an hourly measurement tensor example, collected from the power flow solutions calculated for daily load/generation profiles. Parameter identification is performed on the same example, generated via randomly selected input parameters. The proposed method is illustrated on the case of the static part (ZIP) of a detailed WECC load model, connected to a single bus of a real-world 441-bus power system. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Attempts to reduce the noise from high-performance military aircraft requires an understanding of the different jet noise generation mechanisms. The primary noise sources originate from interactions between turbulent mixing noise associated with large and finescale turbulent structures and the ambient air. A nonideally expanded jet also contains broadband shock-associated noise. A three-way decomposition of the spectral density measured near a tied-down F-35B quantifies the contribution from each type of noise. The decomposition is performed on noise from a ground-based, linear array of microphones, approximately 8 m from the estimated shear layer, which spanned an angular aperture of 35¡ to 152¡ (relative to engine inlet). This large spatial aperture allows for a detailed investigation into the spatial variation in broadband shock-associated noise and fine and large-scale turbulent mixing noise. The spectral decompositions match the measured spectral levels with three main exceptions: 1) the F-35B noise contains multiple spectral peaks in the maximum radiation region, 2) nonlinear propagation increases the high-frequency spectral levels, and 3) the low-frequency levels in the maximum radiation region are less than those predicted by the large-scale similarity spectrum. The main peak of the F-35B broadband shock-associated noise, evident from 35¡-70¡, has the same characteristic shape and variation in peak frequency as overexpanded, laboratory-scale jets. The F-35B broadband shockassociated noise peak level and width exhibit different trends than laboratory-scale BBSAN and those recently reported for the F/A-18E [Tam et al., Journal of Sound and Vibration, Vol. 422, 2018, pp. 92-111]. The strengths and limitations of current models to represent the spatial variation in the spectral content of F-35B noise can guide research efforts to more fully understand the sound radiation from high-performance military aircraft. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

        <gf:abstract>This work introduces a type of motion termed "conceal-and-reveal" which is characterized by a state that protects a payload, a state that exposes the payload, and coupled motions between these two states. As techniques for thick, rigid origami-based engineering designs are being developed, origami is becoming increasingly more attractive as inspiration for complex systems. This paper proposes a process for designing origami-based conceal-and-reveal systems, which can be generalized to design similar thick, rigid origami-based systems. The process is demonstrated through the development of three conceal-and-reveal systems that present a luxury product to the consumer. The three designs also confirm that multiple origami crease patterns can be used to initiate viable approaches to achieving conceal-and-reveal motion. © 2019 by ASME.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This paper presents a vision-based target tracking and following system using a monocular camera on an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS). The R-RANSAC tracker tracks multiple moving objects in the camera field of view and the proposed controller is capable of following a particular target selected by a user while keeping the target in the center of the image. The main contribution of this paper is that multiple objects can be tracked without imposing restrictions such as color, shape, etc. Also, the hardware test shows that the system is able to follow a target autonomously in a real-world outdoor environment. The proposed algorithm is validated on a 3DR X-8 multirotor platform using a downward facing camera. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>The voltage divider phase shift filter (VDPSF) has been used in the past to construct inductorless narrowband filters with moderately high Q values, for example, Q = 50. This work reports a new configuration of this filter that can achieve extremely high Q values over a range of frequencies from very low to very high values. A typical value is Q = 2500, but can be even higher. These high values of Q can be obtained at very low frequencies, solving a long-standing problem for LC tank circuits. The new configuration consists of one voltage divider phase shift filter nested within a second such filter. A simulation is done to verify the accuracy of the theory and demonstrate the stability of Q with respect to circuit element value changes. One significant application of such a filter is in the creation of a tunable oscillator with a very high degree of spectral purity. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Although tremor is one of the most common movement disorders, there are few effective tremor-suppressing options available to patients. Gyrostabilization is a potential option, but we do not currently know how to optimize gyrostabilization for tremor suppression. To address this gap, we present a systematic investigation of how gyrostabilizer parameters affect tremor suppression in a single degree of freedom (DOF). A simple model with a single DOF at the wrist and a gyroscope mounted on the back of the hand was used to focus on the most basic effects. We simulated the frequency response of the system (hand + gyroscope) to a tremorogenic input torque at the wrist. Varying system parameters one at a time, we determined the effect of individual parameters on the system's frequency response. To minimize the bandwidth without adding significant inertia, the inertia and spin speed of the flywheel should be as high as design constraints allow, whereas the distance from the wrist joint axis to the gyroscope and the precession stiffness and damping should be kept as low as possible. The results demonstrate the potential of gyroscopic tremor suppression and can serve as foundation for further investigations of gyroscopic tremor suppression in the upper limb. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Providing RHCP and LHCP outputs from the antennas vertical (V) and horizontal (H) dipoles in the resonant cavity within the antenna feeds is the current practice of ground-based station receivers in aeronautical telemetry. The equalizers on the market, operate on either LHCP or RHCP alone, or a combined signal created by co-phasing and adding the RHCP and LHCP outputs. In this paper, we show how to optimally combine the V and H dipole outputs and demonstrate that an equalizer operating on this optimally-combined signal outperforms an equalizer operating on the RHCP, LHCP, or the combined signals. Finally, we show how to optimally combine the RHCP and LHCP outputs for equalization, where this optimal combination performs as good as the optimally combined V and H signals. © 2019 International Foundation for Telemetering.

    <gf:abstract>Spatiotemporal analysis of noise from a tethered F-35B provides insight into the spatial, spectral and temporal relationships within the sound field. Six engine power conditions ranging from 25% to 150% engine thrust request were measured using a 71-microphone linear ground array located approximately 8 m from the estimated shear layer. Mixing noise trends with engine power for the round-nozzle F-35B are similar to those of a nominally rectangular-nozzle high-performance jet aircraft [Harker et al, AIAA, 2016]. Cross-correlation and coherence measures are used to corroborate and confirm identifications of fine- and large-scale turbulent mixing noise contributions from a concurrent study of the F-35B dataset [Neilsen et al., AIAA, 2018]. The relationships observed between multiple spatiospectral lobes seen in the maximum radiation regions of prior and concurrent high-performance aircraft noise studies [Leete et al., AIAA, 2018] are confirmed and expanded upon. Correlograms help identify how the multiple spatiospectral lobes have different apparent phase speeds across the array, corresponding to different directionality, some components of which also change with engine power. Increased overlap of lobes with increased engine power appears to drive global decreases in field coherence. Finally, the structure of the spatiospectral lobes appears to be more visible in nondimensionalized coherence length than in the spectrum itself. Broadband shock-associated noise (BBSAN) is found in the upstream direction at engine powers of 75% engine thrust request and above. Coherence is also used to separate BBSAN from jet mixing noise because the BBSAN is coherent within the relevant frequency range while adjacent fine-scale mixing noise is not. However, correlation and coherence analyses show that the upstream BBSAN signature is related to sound received in the peak radiation region dominated by the spatiospectral lobes. Possible links between the shock-associated noise and the spatiospectral lobes are discussed. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. All rights reserved.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is widely used to study the brain's white matter (WM) microstructure in a range of psychiatric and neurological diseases. As the diffusion tensor model has limitations in brain regions with crossing fibers, novel diffusion MRI reconstruction models may offer more accurate measures of tissue properties, and a better understanding of the brain abnormalities in specific diseases. Here we studied a large sample of 249 participants with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), a neurogenetic condition associated with high rates of developmental neuropsychiatric disorders, and 224 age-matched healthy controls (HC) (age range: 8-35 years). Participants were scanned with dMRI at eight centers worldwide. Using a meta-analytic approach, we assessed the profile of group differences in four diffusion anisotropy measures to better understand the patterns of WM microstructural abnormalities and evaluate their consistency across alternative measures. When assessed in atlas-defined regions of interest, we found statistically significant differences for all anisotropy measures, all showing a widespread but not always coinciding pattern of effects. The tensor distribution function fractional anisotropy (TDF-FA) showed largest effect sizes all in the same direction (greater anisotropy in 22q11DS than HC). Fractional anisotropy based on the tensor model (FA) showed the second largest effect sizes after TDF-FA; some regions showed higher mean values in 22q11DS, but others lower. Generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) showed the opposite pattern to TDF-FA with most regions showing lower anisotropy in 22q11DS versus HC. Anisotropic power maps (AP) showed the lowest effect sizes also with a mixed pattern of effects across regions. These results were also consistent across skeleton projection methods, with few differences when projecting anisotropy values from voxels sampled on the FA map or projecting values from voxels sampled from each anisotropy map. This study highlights that different mathematical definitions of anisotropy may lead to different profiles of group differences, even in large, well-powered population studies. Further studies of biophysical models derived from multi-shell dMRI and histological validations may help to understand the sources of these differences. 22q11DS is a promising model to study differences among novel anisotropy/dMRI measures, as group differences are relatively large and there exist animal models suitable for histological validation. © SPIE.

    <gf:abstract>Simulating practical combustion systems requires the approximation of the interaction between turbulence, molecular transport and chemical reactions. Turbulent combustion models are used for this purpose, but their behavior is difficult to anticipate based on their mathematical formulations, making the use of numerical experimentation necessary. Therefore, the present work explores the effect of three turbulent-combustion models, two eddy-viscosity models, and their parameters on a combustion problem which is notoriously difficult to model: flame extinction and reignition. For this purpose, two types of temporal jets are considered, and direct-numerical-simulation results are compared qualitatively with those from large-eddy simulations. © 2017 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

    <gf:abstract>Soft robots have the potential to transform the way robots interact with their environment. This is due to their low inertia and inherent ability to more safely interact with the world without damaging themselves or the people around them. However, existing sensing for soft robots has at least partially limited their ability to control interactions with their environment. Tactile sensors could enable soft robots to sense interaction, but most tactile sensors are made from rigid substrates and are not well suited to applications for soft robots which can deform. In addition, the benefit of being able to cheaply manufacture soft robots may be lost if the tactile sensors that cover them are expensive and their resolution does not scale well for manufacturability. This paper discusses the development of a method to make affordable, high-resolution, tactile sensor arrays (manufactured in rows and columns) that can be used for sensorizing soft robots and other soft bodies. However, the construction results in a sensor array that exhibits significant amounts of cross-talk when two taxels in the same row are compressed. Using the same fabric-based tactile sensor array construction design, two different methods for cross-talk compensation are presented. The first uses a mathematical model to calculate a change in resistance of each taxel directly. The second method introduces additional simple circuit components that enable us to isolate each taxel electrically and relate voltage to force directly. Fabric sensor arrays are demonstrated for two different soft-bodied applications: an inflatable single link robot and a human wrist. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Wired Drillpipe (WDP) technology provides two-way and high speed measurements from bottom hole and along-string sensors. The data offered by WDP technology has maximum benefit when applied in an automation system or as a real-time advisory tool. Improved control is demonstrated for Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) with the use of high-speed telemetry and physics-based models. Stabilizing and minimizing pressure within an acceptable bound leads to higher and more consistent Rate of Penetration (ROP). MPD control is challenging due to tight pressure windows and the nonlinearity of the choke and pump response on Bottom Hole Pressure (BHP). This work demonstrates a new Hammerstein-Wiener nonlinear model predictive controller for BHP regulation in drilling. Hammerstein-Wiener models employ input and output static nonlinear blocks before and after linear dynamics blocks and thereby simplify the controller design. The control performance is evaluated in scenarios such as drilling, pipe connections, and kick attenuation. A physics-based drilling simulator, WeMod, is used for model identification and control performance evaluation. The control performance of the new nonlinear controller is compared to conventional controllers in various scenarios. Because of the interconnected multivariable and nonlinear nature of the drilling operation, conventional controllers show severe limitations. In a first scenario, the performance of set point tracking during normal drilling operation is compared. By changing the set point of the BHP, the conventional controller manipulates only the choke valve opening while the nonlinear controller moves choke valve opening, mud pump, and back pressure pump simultaneously. In a second scenario, a pipe connection of a typical drillpipe stand is demonstrated. The conventional controller is not able to regulate the BHP by adjusting the choke valve only. Although a linear version of the controller is able to exploit multivariable relationships, absence of the nonlinear relationships results in severe oscillation when the operational range is shifted outside of the training region. The nonlinear controller maintains a BHP within ±1 bar of the requested set point. A third scenario investigates the kick attenuation performance of conventional and nonlinear control algorithms. The nonlinear controller attenuates the kick within well control conditions, without requiring a well shut-in procedure. Recent advances in drilling simulators and the reliability of the WDP data highway have enabled tighter BHP control. This study presents a robust method to control BHP by applying Hammerstein-Wiener models in an efficient model predictive controller. The proposed methods have been validated in the downstream industry, but are applied for the first time to drilling with nonlinear control functionality. The multivariable control adjusts three main manipulated variables in MPD simultaneously. Copyright © 2017, SPE/IADC Drilling Conference and Exhibition.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>The design of long, linear infrastructure such as pipelines, levees, roads, and canals can be challenging in areas of moderate to high seismicity due to numerous seismic and geologic hazards that can be encountered along proposed alignments. One of the most challenging earthquake-related hazards in the design of large infrastructure is liquefaction-induced lateral spread displacement. This paper presents a new simplified probabilistic approach to estimate lateral spread displacements at targeted return periods across large geographic areas using performance-based lateral spread displacement reference parameter maps and (if available) site-specific geotechnical information. The approach is demonstrated on a hypothetical pipeline extending from Rock Springs, Wyoming, to West Bountiful, Utah, in the United States. Advantages and limitations of the proposed approach are discussed. The results of the demonstrative calculation show how the approach can be used to identify areas where additional geotechnical investigations might be needed, and how probabilistic lateral spread displacements can be easily predicted along numerous proposed alignments of the pipeline once geotechnical subsurface investigation and ground surveys become available. © 2017 ASCE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>The study of post-transformation microstructures and their properties can be greatly enhanced by studying their dependence on the grain boundary content of parent microstructures. Recent work has extended the crystallographic reconstruction of parent austenite in steels to include the reconstruction of special boundaries, such as annealing twins. These reconstructions present unique challenges, as twinned austenite grains share a subset of possible daughter variant orientations. This gives rise to regions of ambiguity in a reconstruction. A technique for the reconstruction of twin boundaries is presented here that is capable of reconstructing 60¡ &lt;1 1 1&gt; twins, even in the case where twin regions are comprised entirely of variants that are common between the twin and the parent. This technique is demonstrated in the reconstruction of lath martensitic steels. The reconstruction method utilizes a delayed decision-making approach, where a chosen orientation relationship is used to define all possible groupings of daughter grains into possible parents before divisive decisions are made. These overlapping, inclusive groupings (called clusters) are compared to each other individually using their calculated parent austenite orientations and the topographical nature of the overlapping region. These comparisons are used to uncover possible locations of twin boundaries present in the parent austenite. This technique can be applied to future studies on the dependence of post-transformation microstructures on the special grain boundary content of parent microstructures. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

    <gf:abstract>Pile foundations supporting bridge abutments are often driven inside corrugated metal pipe sleeves (CMS) which extend through the approach fill to reduce downdrag or for construction expediency. The annular space between the pile and the sleeve is typically filled with uncompacted pea gravel. Designers often assume that the lateral resistance of the pile within the sleeve will be minimal; however, no test results are available to confirm this assumption. To investigate the lateral resistance of piles driven within CMS, a full-scale lateral load test was performed. The test pile configuration included a 32.4 cm (12.75 in.) pipe pile within a 60 cm (24 in.) CMS with uncompacted pea gravel filling the annular space. Results indicate that after small pile displacements, the lateral pile resistance was similar to that provided by an individual pipe pile and was even greater at larger displacements. As the pile displaced laterally, the gravel within the annular space became engaged and displaced the CMS into the compacted fill. Back-analyses indicate that the ultimate lateral pile resistance for this case can be approximated by treating the pipe-gravel-CMS as a composite pile having an EI equal to the pipe pile but with a diameter equal to the CMS. © ASCE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Student capstone teams have varying degrees of success in meeting the expectations of their project sponsors. Keeping sponsors happy is important to these programs in order to ensure continued support from these industry representatives, so finding ways to improve project outcomes is critical. In order to find blind spots that students may have been left with after their first 6-7 weeks of instruction, we conducted structured interviews with students in capstone programs at Brigham Young University and the US Air Force Academy. These interviews were then transcribed, coded, and analyzed for themes that may have been well understood or misunderstood by students. We found that a significant number of students had not understood concepts such as a design being more than a prototype, that sponsors have expectations for the tradeoffs between product cost and performance, or that they need to be thinking about how their designs might be deployed. It was also interesting to note that most students also reported feeling confident in their understanding despite their apparent lack thereof, indicating that these could represent major blind spots for students. We propose that developing methods for teaching these principles early on will help students see more clearly what their end goals need to be, and thus help them be more successful in delivering desirable designs.

        <gf:abstract>This study experimentally and theoretically investigates the dynamics and heat transfer to impinging water droplets on superhydrophobic surfaces heated below the boiling temperature. Different from impingement on hydrophilic substrates, the droplets rebound from the surface after the spreading and retraction stages. Experiments are performed using simultaneous high speed video and infrared (IR) imaging to capture droplet dynamics and temperature variation during the transient event. Thermal images allow estimation of bulk droplet temperature change during contact such that the cooling effectiveness for an individual droplet can be estimated. A similarity solution is utilized to yield a model for the transient heat flux at the droplet-wall interface, where convection inside the droplet is accounted for. The experimental and theoretical results for the cooling effectiveness show good agreement. It is revealed that the cooling effectiveness increases with Weber number but decreases with droplet diameter and surface cavity fraction (the ratio of cavity area to total surface area). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Considerable progress has been achieved in friction stir welding (FSW) of steels in every aspect of tool fabrication, microstructure control and properties evaluation in the past two decades. With the development of reliable welding tools and precise control systems, FSW of steels has reached a new level of technical maturity. High-quality, long welds can be produced in many engineering steels. Compared to traditional fusion welding, FSW exhibits unique advantages producing joints with better properties. As a result of active control of the welding temperature and/or cooling rate, FSW has the capability of fabricating steel joints with excellent toughness and strength. For example, unfavorable phase transformations that usually occur during traditional welding can be avoided and favorable phase fractions in advanced steels can be maintained in the weld zone thus avoiding the typical property degradations associated with fusion welding. If phase transformations do occur during FSW of thick steels, optimization of microstructure and properties can be attained by controlling the heat input and post-weld cooling rate. © 2017</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Obtaining labeled data for activity recognition tasks is a tremendously time consuming, tedious, and labor-intensive task. Often, ground-truth video of the activity is recorded along with sensor-data recorded during the activity. The data must be synchronized with the recorded video to be useful. In this paper, we present and compare two labeling frameworks that each has a different approach to synchronization. Approach A uses time-stamped visual indicators positioned on the data loggers. The approach results in accurate synchronization between video and data but adds more overhead and is not practical when using multiple sensors, subjects, and cameras simultaneously. Also, synchronization needs to be redone for each recording session. Approach B uses Real-Time Clocks (RTCs) on the devices for synchronization, which is less accurate but has several advantages: multiple subjects can be recorded on various cameras, it becomes easier to collect more data, and synchronization only needs to be done once across multiple recording sessions. Therefore, it is easier to collect more data which increases the probability of capturing an unusual activity. The best way forward is likely a combination of both approaches. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>We have previously introduced a monolithic, integrated optical platform for transparent, flat-panel holographic displays suitable for near-to-eye displays in augmented reality systems. This platform employs a guided-wave acousto-optic spatial light modulator implemented in lithium niobate in conjunction with an integrated Bragg-regime reflection volume hologram. In this paper, we depict analysis of three key system attributes that inform and influence the display system performance: 1) single-axis diffraction-driven astigmatism, 2) strobed illumination to enforce acousto-optic grating stationarity, and 3) acousto-optically driven spatial Nyquist rate.

    <gf:abstract>Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) is a disease of the lower limbs that affects millions of people in the United States. CVI results from incompetent venous valves. The purpose of venous valves is to prevent retrograde blood flow to the lower limbs. Valve failure can lead to edema, pain, and ulcers. One solution that has great potential is to create an implantable venous valve that could restore function of the venous system. No prosthetic venous valves are clinically used currently because of problems with biocompatiblility and thrombogenicity caused by high shear rates. This paper presents a prosthetic venous valve that could overcome these difficulties by using carbon-infiltrated carbon nanotubes (CI-CNTs). This material has been proven to be thrombo-resistant, biocompatible due to its non-reactive properties, and durable. The valve was designed to be initially open and to close with physiological pressures. Finite element modeling showed that, with a hydrostatic pressure of 20 mmHg (the minimum hydrostatic pressure in the common femoral vein), it fully closed with a maximum stress of 117 MPa, which is below the ultimate strength of CI-CNTs. A computational fluid dynamics analysis demonstrated the valve would cause a maximum shear rate of 225.1 s_ 1, which is less than the maximum shear rate in the body. Hence, this valve would be less likely than previous prosthetic valves to develop blood clots. Currently, this is the lowest shear rate reported for a prosthetic venous valve. These results demonstrate that a CI-CNT prosthetic venous valve has the potential to be an effective treatment for CVI. Copyright © 2018 ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Students born in a digital era require adjusted teaching and learning methodologies incorporating new technologies. A common difficulty found by students is how to test their controller designs in a real system. Thus, the development of affordable, portable and easy to use feedback control kits is highly desirable. The idea is that both lecturers and students can perform simple practical experiments anytime and anywhere. The APMonitor temperature control lab is an Arduino based control kit which fulfils these requirements. Proportional, integrative and derivative control is in operation in the vast majority of industrial process control loops. Thus, it is a mandatory topic in most undergraduate introductory feedback control courses. A teaching/learning PID control experiment for undergraduate Biomedical Engineering student's based on the temperature control lab is reported here. Results received from students are presented. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Many important aspects of the dynamic thermo-mechanical response of materials occur at the mesoscale, i.e. a physical scale of interactions smaller than what can be adequately described by homogenous behaviors, yet larger than the scale of the atomic lattice. Concurrent advancements in computational power, continuum theory, and experimental diagnostics are enabling unprecedented understanding of such interactions. However, we cannot develop a sufficient level of confidence in such mesoscale capability until the constitutive description of the underlying constituents is reliably representative of their actual physical behavior. Therefore, there is a strong need to combine experimental, modeling, and data-science techniques to validate models of the thermomechanical response of individual single crystals. One experimental diagnostic with high potential impact to shock physics and materials science is in-situ x-ray diffraction. This paper is primarily focused on simulation of x-ray diffraction in shock physics, but with an aim toward quantifying parametric uncertainty of simulation models. We develop and demonstrate a data-science and model-driven approach to constrain the parameterization of continuum models of crystal lattice deformation associated with the shock response of crystalline materials. The framework is built around the connection between continuum hydrodynamic simulations of lattice deformation and a new Bragg diffraction simulation code, BarberShop. The dynamic deformation of a crystal lattice is modeled using the DiscoFlux model within an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian hydrodynamic code, FLAG. These detailed continuum simulations of lattice deformation can be computationally slow, thus a statistical model is used to emulate the evolution of lattice deformation fields in time and across the considered model parameter space. Emulated lattice deformation fields can then be generated rapidly for any combination of physics model parameters. In turn, these fields can be fed into BarberShop to realize a rapid prediction of Bragg diffraction patterns associated with particular values of physics model parameters. The framework enables parameterization of the single crystal model to obtain Bragg diffraction patterns that most closely resemble a corresponding measurement. Furthermore, the framework naturally provides sensitivities of the lattice deformation to the physics parameters. We highlight the utility of this framework through the application to a synthetic closed-loop inverse problem leading to the parameterization of a single crystal material model. As a model problem, we consider the dynamic response of the energetic molecular crystal, cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (or RDX), under dynamic compression induced by simulated flyer plate impact experiments. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>One of the main needs for accurate shrub combustion modeling is the complicated flame growth pattern due to merging of flames from multiple leaves and small branches. The interactions of neighboring flames have only been studied using regularly spaced fuel sources located on a horizontal plane. Flames in a burning shrub or tree merge to form large flames from fuel arrangements, which are not described by horizontal plane geometries. A careful study of flame interactions from fuels in three-dimensional arrangements is a necessary step in strengthening operational field models in complex fuel structures. The purpose of this research is to imitate the flame merging of the solid fuels in different geometries in order to describe fire behavior in complex fuel structures, such as trees or shrubs. Ceramic felt soaked in n-heptane were used as a fuel source to conduct flame-merging experiments. Flame characteristics such as flame length and flame width were measured for both single and merged flames. © 2017 Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute.

        <gf:abstract>Pile foundations for bridges must often resist lateral loads produced by earthquakes and thermal variation. Because of the lack of large scale tests, there is almost no guidance for engineers in assessing the lateral resistance of piles located close to these MSE walls. The objective of this study was to assess lateral pile resistance as a function of distance from the wall face and predict force induced in the reinforcements. Full-scale lateral load tests were conducted on 24 piles located at 2, 3, 4, and 5 pile diameters behind 4.6 and 6-m high MSE walls. P-multipliers were developed to account for the decrease in lateral soil resistance. Little reduction occurred for piles located more than about 4 pile diameters from the wall. Measured tensile forces in the MSE reinforcements increased as the load on the pile increased and decreased rapidly with transverse distance from the direction of loading. Multiple linear regression equations were developed to predict maximum tensile force induced in reinforcing elements by lateral loading. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).All Rights Reserved.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Full annulus URANS simulations are presented to investigate distortion phase shift in a single stage transonic fan. The fan is subject to a 90¡sector inlet total pressure distortion. Simulation results are presented for choke, design, and near-stall operating conditions. Circumferential profiles of swirl, total pressure, total temperature, power, and phase shift are analyzed at 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90% span. Phase shift is a measure of the rotational translation of a distortion profile and is valuable for understanding the translational motion of distortion as it passes through the fan. At choke and design operating conditions the phase shift is positive in the direction of rotor rotation. At near-stall the phase shift is negative opposite rotor rotation for the outer 30% span. Local power reaches a maximum value, resulting in the generation of a uniform pressure region. This region causes increased distortion content in the near-stall case over a wide circumferential extent resulting in a negative phase shift. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

    <gf:abstract>16APSK is a candidate modulation for aeronautical telemetry because it has better spectral efficiency than SOQPSK-TG, but requires a linear RF power amplifier. This paper investigates the BER performance of filter-based equalizers for 16APSK operating over multipath channels measured at Edwards AFB. The results show that decision feedback equalizers outperform the other equalizers and are capable of providing excellent multipath mitigation. © held by the author; distribution rights International Foundation for Telemetering.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The design process for compressor blades is a highly iterative and often slow process. This research applied and measured the impact of using surrogates to quickly model the stresses on a compressor blade. By modeling distinct points on a finite element (FE) model with unique surrogates, the stress field of the entire FE model was quickly predicted. This required that the distinct points remain in the same relative location on each blade used in training the surrogate. This research studied the ability of mesh morphing, and using the surface nodes as those distinct points, to satisfy this requirement. The results show that mesh morphing performed well on the tested compressor blades. The research also found that the surrogate accuracy depended not only on the number of training samples, but also the number and types of parameters being emulated. The surrogate models achieved less than 5% error on all the tested blades. Finally, the method provided a 96% decrease in time required for a structural iteration of a compressor blade. Such speeds eliminate bottlenecks that may occur in the structural design process. The combination of mesh morphing and surrogate modeling in compressor blade analysis enables exploration of various geometric parameters and their effect on structural responses. Application of this process would produce a more thoroughly refined and understood compressor blade design. Copyright © 2018 by ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This paper describes a geometric approach to parameter identifiability analysis in models of power systems dynamics. When a model of a power system is to be compared with measurements taken at discrete times, it can be interpreted as a mapping from parameter space into a data or prediction space. Generically, model mappings can be interpreted as manifolds with dimensionality equal to the number of structurally identifiable parameters. Empirically it is observed that model mappings often correspond to bounded manifolds. We propose a new definition of practical identifiability based the topological definition of a manifold with boundary. In many ways, our proposed definition extends the properties of structural identifiability. We construct numerical approximations to geodesics on the model manifold and use the results, combined with insights derived from the mathematical form of the equations, to identify combinations of practically identifiable and unidentifiable parameters. We give several examples of application to dynamic power systems models. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>In many origami-based applications a device needs to be maintained in one or more fold states. The origami stability integration method (OSIM) presented in this paper provides an approach for graphically combining various techniques to achieve stability. Techniques are divided into four groups based on whether they are intrinsic or extrinsic to the origami pattern and whether they exhibit differentiable or non-differentiable energy storage behaviors. These categorizations can help designers select appropriate techniques for their application. The paper also contains design considerations and resources for several intrinsic techniques. Finally, two case studies are presented which use the OSIM and the technique guidelines to conceptualize stability in origami-based devices. Copyright © 2019 ASME.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>We propose an implementation of an LQR controller for the full-state tracking of a time-dependent trajectory with a multirotor UAV. The proposed LQR formulation is based in Lie theory and linearized at each time step according to the multirotor's current state. We show experiments in both simulation and hardware that demonstrate the proposed control scheme's ability to accurately reach and track a given trajectory. The implementation is shown to run onboard at the full rate of a UAV's estimated state. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects millions of men worldwide. Men with ED generally complain failure to attain or maintain an adequate erection during sexual activity. The prevalence of ED is strongly correlated with age, affecting about 40% of men at age 40 and nearly 70% at age 70. A variety of chronic diseases, including diabetes, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, depression, chronic renal failure, obstructive sleep apnea, prostate disease, gout, and sleep disorder, were reported to be associated with ED. In this study, data retrieved from a subset of the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan were used for designing the clinical decision support system (CDSS) for predicting ED incidences in men. The positive cases were male patients aged 20-65 who were diagnosed with ED between January 2000 and December 2010 confirmed by at least three outpatient visits or at least one inpatient visit, while the negative cases were randomly selected from the database without a history of ED and were frequency (1:1), age, and index year matched with the ED patients. Data of a total of 2832 ED patients and 2832 non-ED patients, each consisting of 41 features including index age, 10 comorbidities, and 30 other comorbidity-related variables, were retrieved for designing the predictive models. Integrated genetic algorithm and support vector machine was adopted to design the CDSSs with two experiments of independent training and testing (ITT) conducted to verify their effectiveness. In the 1st ITT experiment, data extracted from January 2000 till December 2005 (61.51%, 1742 positive cases and 1742 negative cases) were used for training and validating and the data retrieved from January 2006 till December 2010 were used for testing (38.49%), whereas in the 2nd ITT experiment, data in the training set (77.78%) were extracted from January 2000 till Deceber 2007 and those in the testing set (22.22%) were retrieved afterward. Tenfold cross validation and three different objective functions were adopted for obtaining the optimal models with best predictive performance in the training phase. The testing results show that the CDSSs achieved a predictive performance with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, g-mean, and area under ROC curve of 74.72%-76.65%, 72.33%-83.76%, 69.54%-77.10%, 0.7468-0.7632, and 0.766-0.817, respectively. In conclusion, the CDSSs designed based on cost-sensitive objective functions as well as salient comorbidity-related features achieve satisfactory predictive performance for predicting ED incidences. © 2013 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>In May 2016 a workshop entitled "Engaging Students in the STEM Classroom" was presented to faculty at Southern Utah University. Although not exclusive to new faculty, the target audience and predominant attendees, were new faculty from the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines on campus. The three-day workshop focused on basic principles of effective learning and teaching, aligning learning outcomes to assessments and teaching activities, methods for active learning, and strategies for effective classroom presentation. The workshop curriculum was centered around the following goals: 1) promoting broader awareness of alternative teaching strategies for STEM classrooms, 2) increasing faculty comfort level in using alternative teaching strategies, 3) increasing adoption of active learning and other evidence-based pedagogies, 4) building a campus community dedicated to improving teaching, and 5) increasing multi-disciplinary collaborations amongst faculty attendees. The purpose of this paper is to provide an example of a model workshop designed to help new faculty engage students in STEM disciplines, and includes the planning, implementation, and assessment of this workshop. The paper begins by introducing the development of the workshop, including the logic model and assessment plan, the curriculum outline, and preparation processes. The paper also explores the implementation lessons learned. Finally, this paper includes the assessment results of the effectiveness of the workshop in meeting the workshop goals. This includes a preand post-workshop comparison of the participant's attitudes regarding evidence based pedagogies and their perceived competency in using them. This paper is useful for engineering educators in developing teaching expertise, researchers interested in faculty attitudes and perceived competency in using alternate teaching strategies, and faculty and administrators planning to create professional development opportunities to help faculty of all levels become more proficient in evidence-based pedagogies. This paper also serves as an example of a model workshop to develop interdisciplinary communities of educational practice, as well as strengthen the abilities of a new faculty in establishing an engaging and effective classroom. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>The presented research uses a CFD code developed as part of the Computational Research and Engineering Acquisition Tools and Environment (CREATE), Kestrel, to evaluate a single stage compressor at various operating conditions. Time-accurate, full annulus simulations were carried out to capture and analyze the processes leading to stall inception for uniform inlet conditions. Unsteady interaction between tip clearance flow and the detached normal shock inside of the blade passages became more prevalent at flow rates close to stall, and this unsteadiness likely provides a way for leading edge spillage to occur and initiate the stall process. Although reversed flow at the trailing edge plane was not observed to be more prevalent in simulations near stall than in simulations away from stall, the phenomenon was shown to occur in blade passages that were approaching a stall cell. Understanding the physical processes that lead to stall inception allows fan designers to design more robust fans that can safely take advantage of the better performance associated with operating closer to stall. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

    <gf:abstract>Physics-based hydraulic models are essential for proceeding to a high level of automation in drilling. Mathematical models can facilitate process understanding and problem detection, and determine appropriate actions in case of mismatch between model and data. Furthermore, calculations may replace measurements where and when the latter are not available, as normally occurs during connections or when instruments or signal transmissions fail. However, advanced hydraulic models rely on a large set of inputs, such as pipe and wellbore geometry, various tuning parameters and fluid properties. The models are therefore time-consuming and difficult to configure in the field, where third-party experts may be needed at each well, to properly initiate the automation system and adjust it during the drilling process. Although the methods described in this paper are relevant to any critical drilling operation, they are applied to Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) as a widely deployed example of drilling automation. In MPD, hydraulic models predict downhole conditions and determine the requisite choke pressure for automatic adjustment. A new method for automatic configuration of key model parameters simplifies the tedious job of setting up the model and ensures that the automation system remains tuned to the well, even without onsite model tuning expertise. The proposed scheme is based on a simple method for separating inaccuracies due to co-linearity in frictional pressure losses and static mud weight. The search for optimal correction factors is based on a sequence of small oscillations of pump rate that can be applied during drilling without interrupting the operation. A massively parallel computing architecture improves the speed of the calibration algorithm proportional to the number of available CPU cores. A set of hydraulic model instances runs in parallel, allowing for efficient testing of changes in input signals within ranges of uncertainty. A method for selecting a subset of the best models that more accurately represent a given well is proposed. Computer simulations demonstrate how the novel calibration scheme allows automatic tuning of the friction factor and density correction factor, giving accurate prediction of the bottom hole pressure (BHP). The tuning scheme is run with a parallel architecture to demonstrate that correct values of unknown configuration parameters can be automatically determined sufficiently fast for real-time drilling control or as an advisory tool. The deployment of automation systems in drilling is hampered by the need for dedicated expert personnel to maintain systems that could have reduced the personnel needed on the rig. The proposed automated physics-based model tuning contributes to removing this roadblock, aiming at making automation systems a more cost-efficient option for drilling operations.

        <gf:abstract>Engineered products often have more social impacts than are realized. A product review was conducted to bring this to light. In this paper, we show the extent to which different social impacts in 11 impact categories are co-present in 150 products and how this can help engineers and others during the product development process. Specifically, we show how social impact categories not previously considered can be identified. The product review resulted in 13,200 data points that were divided into two data sets, one with 8800 data points from which a social impact probability table was created. The remaining data points were then used to validate the table. All data points were then combined to create a final social impact probability table. This table provides insight for how various social impact categories correlate and can assist engineers in expanding their views to include additional social impact objectives and thus achieve a design with broader social impact or a design with minimized unwanted negative social impact. A simple method for predicting social impact is also created in order to assist engineers when developing products with social impacts in mind. © 2019 by ASME.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Promoting ethical conduct and social responsibility among undergraduate engineering graduates has been an ongoing challenge for many universities around the world. Among many factors shaping such commitments, the ethical climate within engineering degree programs specifically and universities more generally seems especially pertinent. Yet there remains a lack of research on, and understanding about, engineering students' perceptions of ethical climate, including how this changes over time and impacts their professional formation and values. This paper draws on an NSF-funded, mixed-methods, longitudinal research project conducted across four U.S. universities. The larger project aims to investigate perceptions and attitudes around ethics, social responsibility, and related concepts among engineering students. In this paper, we more specifically explore various facets of ethical climate across the three schools through a mixed-method explanatory study. We focus on quantitative survey measures (n=257) and qualitative interview data (n=33) collected from engineering students during their first and final years of college. We more specifically shed light on three main research objectives. First, we investigate how engineering students perceive ethical climate across the four universities. Second, we explore how students' perceptions of ethical climate change over time. Third, we look at how specific experiences may contribute to students' ethical climate perceptions, including changes over time. This study will appeal to engineering educators, policymakers and researchers who are interested in research on ethics, social responsibility, and related topics. By providing foundational insights about students' perceptions of ethical climate, we hope to inform strategies to improve the ethical climate at universities and ethical commitments of engineers. © 2020 SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

    <gf:abstract>In this paper, we analyze several DFT-based frequency offset estimators for use with the 16-APSK digital modulation scheme. Even a small frequency offset between radio transmitters and receivers can cause phase information to be lost, so a system to align the phases is required to reliably demodulate PSK signals. These estimators have been adapted for 16-APSK from methods originally intended for use with QPSK and CPM. These methods consist of a coarse search and a fine search with an optional dichotomous search to improve accuracy. We analyze the estimator error variance and bit error rate associated with several methods of frequency estimation. These estimators exhibit small estimate error and variance and can provide bit error rates close to the ideal AWGN BER. © 2019 International Foundation for Telemetering.

    <gf:abstract>One of the hallmarks of real networks is the ability to perform increasingly complex tasks as their topology evolves. To explain this, it has been observed that as a network grows certain subsets of the network begin to specialize the function(s) they perform. A recent model of network growth based on this notion of specialization has been able to reproduce some of the most well-known topological features found in real-world networks including right-skewed degree distributions, the small world property, modular as well as hierarchical topology, etc. Here we describe how specialization under this model also effects the spectral properties of a network. This allows us to give the conditions under which a network is able to maintain its dynamics as its topology evolves. Specifically, we show that if a network is intrinsically stable, which is a stronger version of the standard notion of global stability, then the network maintains this type of dynamics as the network evolves. This is one of the first steps toward unifying the rigorous study of the two types of dynamics exhibited by networks. These are the dynamics of a network, which is the topological evolution of the network's structure, modeled here by the process of network specialization, and the dynamics on a network, which is the changing state of the network elements, where the type of dynamics we consider is global stability. The main examples we apply our results to are recurrent neural networks, which are the basis of certain types of machine learning algorithms. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>California's high-speed rail (HSR) system is slated to traverse nearly the entire length of the state, and thus it will be exposed to seismic risks from almost every known major tectonic fault there. The present study deals with the seismic responses of bridge-abutment transition backfills (BATBs), which are essential components of HSR bridges. BATBs provide a gradual variation of vertical stiffness between the bridge deck and nominal engineered backfill, enabling smooth operations for trains traveling at high speeds. All prior investigations focused on this vertical stiffness in order to better characterize the localized vertical differential movements around BATBs under periodic high axial loads from train sets. Lateral behavior of BATBs, which would be important under seismic loads, has not previously been investigated. The present study offers a parametric nonlinear lateral force-displacement backbone curve for BATBs that is verified against three-dimensional finite-element models and validated against data from large-scale tests conducted at Brigham Young University. The parametric curve takes backwall height as well as abutment skew angle into account. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Swarm robotic systems are gaining in interest with the prospect of their use for various applications, including monitoring, tracking, infrastructure support, and protection. Prior human-swarm system research investigated transparency for these systems, but assumed perfect communication scenarios. Real-world human-swarm systems will not have perfect communication due to human processing limitations caused by a large number of individual entities, emergent behavior due to varying environments, and bandwidth issues. Factors that affect transparency or are influenced by transparency were identified from various humanÐmachine system domains; however, understanding the relationship between factors can help designers identify what criteria can be implemented to achieve transparency for swarms. Challenges that may arise based on transparency criteria from humanÐmachine systems are examined to identify improvements for spatial swarm systems. © 2019, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>To decrease lateral earth pressures on structures, a zone of compressible material or an "inclusion" can be used as a barrier to decrease lateral earth pressures on structures. The compressible material is typically expanded polystyrene or geofoam. Little guidance is available on the development of passive force with an inclusion. To explore this issue, large-scale passive force tests were conducted with and without a geofoam inclusion acting as a barrier between the backfill soil and a simulated bridge abutment. The presence of the geofoam inclusion reduced the passive force by 70% relative to the sand backfill alone. Although the measured force and failure geometry appeared to conform to a log-spiral mechanism when only sand backfill was used, the geofoam inclusion transforms the failure geometry to a Rankine failure mechanism. This suggests that the geofoam acted to reduce the interface friction between the wall and the backfill sand thereby reducing the passive resistance. © ASCE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Accessing clean water is a persistent, and life threatening, challenge for millions of people in the world. Mechanical hand pumps have a long history of helping people access clean ground water for drinking and daily use. Among the most ubiquitous are the India Mark II and III pump systems, for which there are more than 4,000,000 installed across the world. These are estimated to serve between 600M and 1B people. All pumps degrade in performance over time, requiring service; many do not receive it causing pumps to become dysfunctional. The purpose of this paper is to establish a baseline for nitrile seal performance of India Mark II hand pump systems. Understanding off-the-shelf performance and using it as a baseline is an important step toward understanding degradation of performance over time, which is the focus of a much larger study to understand Ð mechanically and socially Ð how hand pumps perform, degrade, and ultimately meet human needs. In this paper, 110 off-the-shelf nitrile seals that were purchased in Uganda were tested and the following was characterized: (i) geometric variation, (ii) material variation, (iii) leak performance, and (iv) correlation between these. The seal leak performance was found to be very robust to variations in geometry and material at zero cycles. This important baseline supports our future work to understand how and to what degree seals become sensitive to geometric and material degradation during use. Copyright © 2019 ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>With the advancement in technology and increased demand on skilled workers these days, education becomes a stepping stone in securing jobs with long-term perspective. As competition for admission into higher education increases, it becomes even more important for applicants to find graduate schools that fit their requirements and expectation. Selecting appropriate schools to apply, however, is a time-consuming process, especially when looking for schools at graduate level due to the various factors in decision making imposed by the schools and applicants. In this paper, we propose a recommendation system that suggests appealing graduate programs to students based on the Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor approaches. As graduate programs make decisions based on applicants' qualification, our recommender considers user's personal data and data of various graduate programs obtained from online education portals to make suggestions. We conduct an empirical study using data of current graduate schools and former graduate school applicants, and the performance evaluation validates the merit of our suggestions. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Nanotechnology-based therapeutic approaches have attracted attention of scientists, in particular due to the special features of nanomaterials, such as adequate biocompatibility, ability to improve therapeutic efficiency of incorporated drugs and to limit their adverse effects. Among a variety of reported nanomaterials for biomedical applications, metal and metal oxide-based nanoparticles offer unique physicochemical properties allowing their use in combination with conventional antimicrobials and as magnetic field-controlled drug delivery nanocarriers. An ever-growing number of studies demonstrate that by combining magnetic nanoparticles with membrane-active, natural human cathelicidin-derived LL-37 peptide, and its synthetic mimics such as ceragenins, innovative nanoagents might be developed. Between others, they demonstrate high clinical potential as antimicrobial, anti-cancer, immunomodulatory and regenerative agents. Due to continuous research, knowledge on pleiotropic character of natural antibacterial peptides and their mimics is growing, and it is justifying to stay that the therapeutic potential of nanosystems containing membrane active compounds has not been exhausted yet. © 2020 The Author(s).</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>In some design situations, in construction systems with structural masonry, an increase in the capacity of the walls is required, which can be achieved with the filling of empty cells of masonry blocks with grout. The Brazilian technical standard for clay masonry blocks aiming at attaining greater agility and flexibility in the construction process allows the use of bedding mortar instead of grout to fill the cells of the blocks. In this context, the objective of this study was to evaluate the mechanical behaviour of prisms filled with bedding mortar. Six classes of mortar and one type of clay block with nominal resistance of 6 MPa were studied. The results of the compressive strength of the prisms indicate the viability of using bedding mortar with the same structural function as grout. This article presents also an analytical study to evaluate the mechanical behaviour of clay block prisms filled with mortar. Analyses were conducted using general-purpose, nonlinear finite element software that simulates structural behaviour under different loading scenarios. A three-dimensional model of the prisms was developed using eight-node brick elements for both block and mortar with nonlinear properties assigned to each material.

    <gf:abstract>Use of online learning systems, such as learner dashboards, is increasing in university chemistry courses. Learning analytics can support student learning by providing feedback on concept mastery. This paper investigated how student use of a chemistry learner dashboard might be increased through class structure, instructor practice, and dashboard design changes across three iterations in a general chemistry course. Once acceptable levels of student dashboard use were achieved, further investigation of how students interacted with the dashboard, including accessing the variety of available resources, was conducted. Survey data and clickstream data from the dashboard were collected and analyzed in a convergent mixed methods design. This study found that changes in course structure, teacher practice, and dashboard design increased use of the dashboard and utilization of the variety of materials offered in it. Recommendations for instructors to effectively utilize a learner dashboard and increase student trust in the system are provided. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Cadaveric decellularized bone tissue is utilized as an allograft in many musculoskeletal surgical procedures. Typically, the allograft acts as a scaffold to guide tissue regeneration with superior biocompatibility relative to synthetic scaffolds. Traditionally these scaffolds are machined into the required dimensions and shapes. However, the geometrical simplicity and, in some cases, limited dimensions of the donated tissue restrict the use of allograft scaffolds. This could be overcome by additive manufacturing using granulated bone that is both decellularized and demineralized. In this study, the large area projection sintering (LAPS) method is evaluated as a fabrication method to build porous structures composed of granulated cortical bone bound by polycaprolactone (PCL). This additive manufacturing method utilizes visible light to selectively cure the deposited material layer-by-layer to create 3D geometry. First, the spreading behavior of the composite mixtures is evaluated and the conditions to attain improved powder bed density to fabricate the test specimens are determined. The tensile strength of the LAPS fabricated samples in both dry and hydrated states are determined and compared to the demineralized cancellous bone allograft and the heat treated demineralized-bone/PCL mixture in mold. The results indicated that the projection sintered composites of 45Ð55 wt %. Demineralized bone matrix (DBM) particulates produced strength comparable to processed and demineralized cancellous bone. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

        <gf:abstract>This paper demonstrates a feasible method for using a deep neural network as a sensor to estimate the attitude of a flying vehicle using only flight video. A dataset of still images and associated gravity vectors was collected and used to perform supervised learning. The network builds on a previously trained network and was trained to be able to approximate the attitude of the camera with an average error of about 8 degrees. Flight test video was recorded and processed with a relatively simple visual odometry method. The aircraft attitude is then estimated with the visual odometry as the state propagation and network providing the attitude measurement in an extended Kalman filter. Results show that the proposed method of having the neural network provide a gravity vector attitude measurement from the flight imagery reduces the standard deviation of the attitude error by approximately 12 times compared to a baseline approach. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Linkage origami is one effective approach for addressing stiffness and accommodating panels of finite size in origami models and tessellations. However, successfully implementing linkage origami in tessellations can be challenging. In this work, multiple theorems are presented that provide criteria for designing origami units or cells that can be assembled into arbitrarily large tessellations. The application of these theorems is demonstrated through examples of tessellations in two and three dimensions. Copyright © 2019 ASME.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This work examines metrics for target reachability and source observability in dynamical networks, which are especially relevant in a network security context. Specifically, the energy required to control a target node in a network from a remote input is characterized, and dually the fidelity with which a source state can be estimated from a remote measurement is studied. The work highlights an essential asymmetry between the problems: We show that target reachability is often easy, while source observability is almost always impossible. Several spectral and graph-theoretic results are also presented, which give structural insight into how easy or hard target control and source estimation are. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This investigation contributes to design assessment practice by examining how public assessment can enhance project-based learning. Project-based learning is designed to provide students with an opportunity to engage in authentic problem finding and solving. Students often become very involved with the specifics of their project without always noticing what they are learning. As such, it becomes essential to engage them in reflection during the process and at the completion of the project. A constellation of formative and summative assessment activities that include self, group, and instructor, can aid the learner in this contemplation. We propose that public assessment in the form of a student-run sale can provide distinctive feedback to students. Our experience with student-run retail sales over multiple years has lead us to identify some unique characteristics of this type of public assessment. These include a positive effect on student motivation, independent validation in a face-to-face setting, and providing direct consumer feedback to students. In this paper we discuss assessment practice as it relates to the sale and review student reflections on the experience to determine its usefulness.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Surface water can affect the properties of metal oxide nanoparticles. Investigations on several systems revealed that nanoparticles have different thermodynamic properties than their bulk counterparts due to adsorbed water on their surfaces. Some thermodynamically metastable phases of bulk metal oxides become stable when reduced to the nanoscale, partially due to interactions between high energy surfaces and surface water. Water adsorption microcalorimetry and high-temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry, low-temperature specific heat calorimetry, and inelastic neutron scattering are used to understand the interactions of surface water with metal oxide nanoparticles. Computational methods, such as molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations, have been used to study these interactions. Investigations on titania, cassiterite, and alumina illustrate the insights gained by these measurements. The energetics of water on metal oxide surfaces are different from those of either liquid water or hexagonal ice, and there is substantial variation in water interactions on different metal oxide surfaces.

    <gf:abstract>The conventional cascode circuit has long been used as the basis for the differential input stage to an op amp. The voltage gain of this stage can be maximised by operating the MOS devices in the moderate inversion region rather than the strong inversion region. In so doing, the voltage gains of the differential stage can reach values of over 120ÊdB and the power dissipation is minimised due to the low currents required. Harmonic distortion is also minimised by moderate inversion operation. Although the composite cascode or self-cascode has been successfully used as an op-amp differential stage, the conventional cascode differential circuit offers additional advantages and is compared to the composite cascode differential circuit in this work. A design procedure is also reported in this work for low-power, high voltage gain differential stages. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Since 2004, Brigham Young University has offered a graduate study abroad course in mechanical engineering to help prepare students to be leaders in globally-influenced product development organizations. The course is offered as a study abroad program where faculty lead a group of students across several countries to learn about global product development. This is accomplished in a 2-3 week time period consisting of visits to companies and universities as well as participation in cultural activities. While much research has been done on the benefits of study abroad, it remains unclear how effective study abroad programs are at helping engineering students, especially short-term study abroad programs. The purpose of this paper is to present and examine the benefits of a short-term, study abroad program to engineering students. Data was collected from students who have taken the Global Product Development Course over the past 15 years in a mixed methods survey. Trends show that technical and cultural visits positively effect engineering students in their perception of global product development. It is also shown that a short, 2-3 week, engineering study abroad program can be as or more effective than traditional study abroad programs in certain areas. Copyright © 2019 ASME.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Liquid composite molding (LCM) is growing in importance as an alternative to traditional prepreg-autoclave methods for manufacture high-performance composites. The most significant roadblock to industryÕs implementation of LCM is the usually higher void content compared with prepreg processing. One tool for reducing void levels in LCM involves optimization of flow velocity, which requires models to be developed to describe void formation at a given velocity. To help solve this problem, the following research illustrates the first known method for optical void measurement in situ during infusion in a carbon fiber reinforcement. Similar to previous studies on glass fiber, this work utilizes fluorescent dye and a digital camera to produce sufficient contrast and resolution for image analysis. Visible bubbles are photographed against the opaque carbon fiber background. An automated method of image analysis is outlined, which was used to analyze 230 images for three different flow orientations of a single fabric, producing the highest amount of experimental data seen so far on in situ void measurement. The resulting data identifies a minimum velocity threshold for minimal macro-void formation. The resultant void characterization framework will better enable optimization of LCM processing for high-performance composites based on carbon reinforcements. © The Author(s) 2020.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The problem of precision landing for autonomous multirotor UAVs operating during the day and at night is studied. A vision-based approach is proposed and consists of varying-degree-of-freedom image-based visual servoing (VDOF IBVS), and a specialized landing marker. The proposed approach is validated through extensive flight testing outdoors in both daylight and after-dark conditions, and is done using a standard off-the-shelf autopilot system. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>The security guarantees of secure messaging applications are contingent upon users performing an authentication ceremony, which typically involves verifying the fingerprints of encryption keys. However, recent lab studies have shown that users are unable to do this without being told in advance about the ceremony and its importance. A recent study showed that even with this instruction, the time it takes users to find and complete the ceremony is excessively long-about 11 minutes. To remedy these problems, we modified Signal to include prompts for the ceremony and also simplified the ceremony itself. To gauge the effect of these changes, we conducted a between-subject user study involving 30 pairs of participants. Our study methodology includes no user training and only a small performance bonus to encourage the secure behavior. Our results show that users are able to both find and complete the ceremony more quickly in our new version of Signal. Despite these improvements, many users are still unsure or confused about the purpose of the authentication ceremony. We discuss the need for better risk communication and methods to promote trust. © 2018 by The USENIX Association All Rights Reserved.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>In this work we apply a systems-theoretic approach to identifying trend setters on Twitter. A network reconstruction algorithm was applied to Twitter data to determine causal relationships among topics discussed by popular Twitter users. Causal relationships in this context means that the topics tweeted by a single user influences the topics tweeted by another user, regardless of sentiment. A user that causally influences other users, without themselves being strongly influenced is identified as a trendsetter. This work seeks to identify potential trendsetters among popular Twitter users and demonstrating that causal influence does not always directly correlate with a user's popularity in terms of followers-demonstrating that popularity alone may not be sufficient for identifying trendsetters on Twitter. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Hardware and software technologies that enable unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) to reliably sense and avoid (SAA) other aircraft are critical to the safe operation of UAS beyond an operator's line of sight. For small UAS, the need is especially critical because of the clutter and the air-traffic density at low altitudes where they operate. For the community of researchers who are developing SAA technology for small UAS, there is a critical need for a rich, openly-accessible compendium of encounter data with which to develop, test, and evaluate SAA algorithms. In this paper we introduce a publicly available database of small UAS encounter data, the small aircraft flight encounter (SAFE) database, with an initial deposit of 11 flight encounters. In these encounters two target aircraft, a fixed-wing and a multi-rotor are imaged by a separate fixed-wing aircraft carrying two high-definition video cameras and a unique radar unit. The data contain ground-truth navigation estimates for both the target and imaging aircraft. The target aircraft are observed in the video footage but not in the radar imagery; continuing efforts include tuning and refinement of the radar parameters and expansion of the SAFE database to support small UAS SAA technology development. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

    <gf:abstract>SSL/TLS libraries are notoriously hard for developers to use, leaving system administrators at the mercy of buggy and vulnerable applications. We explore the use of the standard POSIX socket API as a vehicle for a simplified TLS API, while also giving administrators the ability to control applications and tailor TLS configuration to their needs. We first assess OpenSSL and its uses in open source software, recommending how this functionality should be accommodated within the POSIX API. We then propose the Secure Socket API (SSA), a minimalist TLS API built using existing network functions and find that it can be employed by existing network applications by modifications requiring as little as one line of code. We next describe a prototype SSA implementation that leverages network system calls to provide privilege separation and support for other programming languages. We end with a discussion of the benefits and limitations of the SSA and our accompanying implementation, noting avenues for future work. © 2018 Proceedings of the 27th USENIX Security Symposium.

        <gf:abstract>The purpose of this research was to design, fabricate, and test coronary stent designs composed of carbon-infiltrated carbon nanotubes (CI-CNTs). Coronary stents currently have two major complications: restenosis and thrombosis. CI-CNT stents may provide improved clinical outcomes for both of these issues. Multiple stent design concepts were generated, evaluated, and two stent designs were selected: one with a semi-auxetic nature, and one designed for maximum force. These designs were further developed and optimized using analytical tools along with finite element analysis. Planar versions of the stent designs were manufactured and mechanically tested to verify performance. The performance of the cylindrical stent configurations was analyzed using finite element modeling. A sample cylindrical stent was also fabricated. This research demonstrates that feasible coronary stent designs can be manufactured from CI-CNTs. However, a major challenge for CI-CNT stent designs is meeting the design requirement of sufficient radial force. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Wind-induced bending loads frequently cause failure of maize (corn) stalks. When failure occurs, it usually manifests as transverse buckling. Because this failure mode is closely related to transverse tissue stiffness, the purpose of this study was to develop a method for measuring the transverse Young's modulus of maize stalk rind and pith tissues. Short, disc-shaped stalk segments were used for this purpose. X-ray computed tomography was used to obtain the geometry of each specimen prior to testing. Each specimen was tested in two different configurations. Computed tomography data was used to create a specimen-specific finite element model of each test specimen. Data from the first testing configuration was used in conjunction with the finite element model to determine the Young's Modulus values for each specimen. The specimen-specific finite element models provided estimates of the stress states in the stem under transverse loading, and these stress states accurately predicted the location of failure in transverse test specimens. The entire testing method was validated using data from one test configuration to predict the structural response of each specimen during the second test configuration. © 2018</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>The soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) is of fundamental importance for understanding the characteristics and behavior of unsaturated soil. Recent improvements in measuring suction provided the ability to make fast, accurate SWCCs in the lab but sample throughput drastically limits the number that can be produced. Collocating matric suction and water content sensors in situ would add many more SWCCs to the knowledge base. The objective of this study is to determine how well in situ generated SWCCs using a new, calibrated matric sensor compare to those created in the lab. Field and lab SWCCs compared quite well, but a few factors reduced their agreement. In coarser textured soils, living roots caused a divergence as the soil suction increased. Not surprisingly, intact core samples compared more favorably than disturbed. In finer textured soils, comparisons were favorable, but were also affected when laboratory samples were disturbed. Data suggest collocated in situ sensors could provide an important augmentation to laboratory data for developing a wide range of SWCCs. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

        <gf:abstract>Electric distribution utilities have an obligation to inform the public and government regulators about when they expect to complete service restoration after a major storm. In this study, we explore methods for calculating the estimated time of restoration (ETR) from weather impacts, defined as the time it will take for 99.5% of customers to be restored. Actual data from Storm Irene (2011), the October Nor'easter (2011) and Hurricane Sandy (2012) within the Eversource Energy-Connecticut service territory were used to calibrate and test the methods; data used included predicted outages, the peak number of customers affected, a ratio of how many outages a restoration crew can repair per day, and the count of crews working per day. Data known before a storm strikes (such as predicted outages and available crews) can be used to calculate ETR and support pre-storm allocation of crews and resources, while data available immediately after the storm passes (such as customers affected) can be used as motivation for securing or releasing crews to complete the restoration in a timely manner. Used together, the methods presented in this paper will help utilities provide a reasonable, data-driven ETR without relying solely on qualitative past experiences or instinct. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>An inducer is used as the first stage of high suction performance pump. It pressurizes the fluid to delay the onset of cavitation, which can adversely affect performance in a centrifugal pump. In this paper, the performance of a water pump inducer has been explored with and without the implementation of a stability control device (SCD). This device is an inlet cover bleed system that removes high-energy fluid near the blade leading edge and reinjects it back upstream. The research was conducted by running multiphase, time-accurate computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations at the design flow coefficient and at low, off-design flow coefficients. The suction performance and stability for the same inducer with and without the implementation of the SCD has been explored. An improvement in stability and suction performance was observed when the SCD was implemented. Without the SCD, the inducer developed backflow at the blade tip, which led to rotating cavitation and larger rotordynamic forces. With the SCD, no significant cavitation instabilities developed, and the rotordynamic forces remained small. The lack of cavitation instabilities also allowed the inducer to operate at lower inlet pressures, increasing the suction performance of the inducer. Copyright © 2018 by ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Of the many valid configurations that a curved fold may assume, it is of particular interest to identify natural - or lowest energy - configurations that physical models will preferentially assume. We present normalized coordinate equations - equations that relate fold surface properties to their edge of regression - to simplify curved-fold relationships. An energy method based on these normalized coordinate equations is developed to identify natural configurations of general curved folds. While it has been noted that natural configurations have nearly planar creases for curved folds, we show that nonplanar behavior near the crease ends substantially reduces the energy of a fold. © 2019 ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This paper presents a method of tracking multiple ground targets from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in a 3D reference frame. The tracking method uses a monocular camera and makes no assumptions on the shape of the terrain or the target motion. The UAV runs two cascaded estimators. The first is an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which is responsible for tracking the UAV's state, such as position and velocity relative to a fixed frame. The second estimator is an EKF that is responsible for estimating a fixed number of landmarks within the camera's field of view. Landmarks are parameterized by a quaternion associated with bearing from the camera's optical axis and an inverse distance parameter. The bearing quaternion allows for a minimal representation of each landmark's direction and distance, a filter with no singularities, and a fast update rate due to few trigonometric functions. Three methods for estimating the ground target positions are demonstrated: the first uses the landmark estimator directly on the targets, the second computes the target depth with a weighted average of converged landmark depths, and the third extends the target's measured bearing vector to intersect a ground plane approximated from the landmark estimates. Simulation results show that the third target estimation method yields the most accurate results. © 2017, Institute of Navigation.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) algorithms involve an 'oracle' user with unmodeled biases that selects a preferred output among several possible hypotheses. We identify a shortcoming and training obstacle of the recent Stochastic Multiple Choice Learning (sMCL) algorithm. When an ensemble of neural networks trains under sMCL, the best performing model receives the majority of parameter updates at the expense of other ensemble members. We refer to this sMCL training issue as Alpha Model Domination (AMD) and empirically demonstrate that AMD does not resolve itself with longer training time. We introduce several novel MCL loss functions that both avoid AMD and yield statistically significant improvements in oracle accuracy (OA) compared to sMCL. Using the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet classification datasets, we empirically demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed loss functions. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This paper shows that burst-based orthogonal spacetime block-coded ARTM CPM is capable of solving the two-antenna problem in aeronautical telemetry, but detection requires a prohibitively complex trellis detector. In single-input, single-output (SISO) applications, pulse truncation and state-space partitioning reduce the computational complexity of the trellis detector with only modest bit error rate (BER) performance penalties. In this paper it is shown that layering pulse truncation and state-space partition complexity-reducing techniques with a burst-based orthogonal space-time block-code does not introduce additional BER performance losses relative to the SISO case. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>For almost ten years, the majority of students in the College of Engineering and Technology at Brigham Young University have been required to take a sophomore level leadership foundations course focused on leadership principles, ethics, and global issues. The course is part of an overall leadership framework whereby students are introduced to the importance of leadership as freshmen, learn foundational leadership principles as sophomores, and practice these principles as juniors and seniors. The leadership foundations course is required for graduation by 7 of 10 programs within the College of Engineering and Technology. Students external to the college also participate in the course as it fulfills two general education requirements for graduation. As a result, the college teaches approximately 12 sections each academic year averaging 60-80 students per section. Approximately 10-15% of student course participants are external to the college. In this paper a survey is presented of 163 students initially enrolled in the leadership foundations course regarding their perceptions and attitudes towards leadership. Results include a comparison of students who are required to take the course and those for whom it is optional. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups of students except for their expectation regarding workload. The engineering and technology students expected the leadership foundations course to be easier, relative to their other classes, than the nonengineering and technology group. In general, both sets of students had high expectations for the course and expressed positive attitudes towards learning about leadership. For example, students in both groups indicated they felt learning about leadership was somewhat more important than learning the skills of their discipline. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Temperature control of friction stir welding (FSW) via model predictive control (MPC) is investigated in Al 7075-T7. Two MPC controllers are compared against two well-tuned PID controllers to obtain a direct comparison of MPC and current FSW controllers. One MPC controller uses a first-order plus dead-time (FOPDT) model derived from a simplified conduction-advection view of the stir zone. The other MPC controller uses the Hybrid Heat Source model that describes heat conduction in the plate and tool. At quasi steady-state conditions, all four controllers can easily hold temperature within 2 ¡C of the setpoint in the absence of large disturbances. Once the weld is past the initial traverse, the FOPDT controller is superior to the Hybrid Heat Source controller with regards to modeled-disturbance rejection and setpoint changes. The FOPDT controller is competitive with well-tuned PID controllers in this region of the weld. During the initial traverse, the Hybrid Heat Source controller and PID controller with regulator gains were able to control temperature within 5 ¡C of the setpoint, compared to a typical deviation of 20Ð30 ¡C when uncontrolled. During this period, the FOPDT controller and PID controller with servo gains could not maintain satisfactory temperature control. MPC is demonstrated to be a viable control method for FSW. Temperature control before reaching steady state for both MPC and PID is shown to be feasible, but more difficult than for steady state. Recommendations are given for when each controller might be preferred in various circumstances, based upon the results shown herein. © 2017 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>The Scaled SLW model for prediction of radiation transfer in non-uniform gaseous media is presented. Construction of the scaled spectral model is described. The model development yields a scaling coefficient which, unlike previous scaled model approaches, is calculated by explicit expressions in terms of the first and minus first moments of absorption cross-section. The Scaled SLW model complements the previously developed correlated SLW models. The proposed scaled model is suitable for engineering applications in comprehensive heat and mass transfer problems. © 2017, Begell House Inc. All Rights Reserved.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Applying an origami pattern to thick, non-paper-like materials is a challenging task. Though many techniques have been developed to accommodate thickness in origami, creating 3D models of such thick-origami mechanisms is complex. The time and knowledge required to manually model an origami mechanism can impede the exploration of the design space and creation of robust designs. This work presents data structures based on origami that can be used in the automation of thick-origami mechanism design. These structures are described and an example computer program that implements them is investigated. The program automatically generates all the necessary 3D CAD part models and an assembly model for a user-specified origami crease pattern. Models resulting from the program for several crease patterns are demonstrated with a discussion of the advantages and limitations of the system. With further development of the data structures and program, this framework has the potential to help mitigate some of the barriers to more widespread use of origami-based design.

        <gf:abstract>This paper continues to document the design, development, and test of a friction-based (non-adhesive) post-installable fiberoptic strain sensing system for oil and gas applications - especially those that require deployment on existing subsea structures. (Ref: OMAE2017-61494 Development and Testing of a Friction-Based Post-Installable Sensor for Subsea FiberOptic Monitoring Systems [1]). The prototype fiber-optic monitoring system collects a wide range of real-time data, which can be used to determine structural loading, fatigue, temperature, pressure, and flow assurance on operational platforms. The primary challenge of a post-installed instrumentation monitoring system is to ensure secure coupling between the sensors and the structure of interest for reliable measurements. Friction-based coupling devices have the potential to overcome installation challenges caused by marine growth and soil contamination on subsea structures, flowlines, or risers. This particular design solution is compatible with structures that are suspended in the water column and those that are resting on the seabed. In addition, the system can be installed by commercial divers in shallow depths or by remotely operated vehicles in deep-water applications. Operational limitations of the initial design concept were identified in the previous series of tests (2016-2017), and several innovative enhancements have been implemented which resulted in significant improvements in sensor system coupling and strain measurement correlation with traditional strain measuring devices. This paper provides a summary of the notable prototype design changes, full-scale test article buildup, and detailed performance data recorded during tension and compression loading that simulated representative offshore conditions. The test results were positive and demonstrated the effectiveness of the design enhancements. Compromises made during mounting of the sensing elements resulted in better performance in tension than compression. These effects are well understood and are fully discussed, and do not influence the viability of the design changes. This study is part of a continuing collaboration between the Houston-based NASA-Johnson Space Center and Astro Technology, Inc. within a study called Clear Gulf. The primary objective of the Clear Gulf study is to develop advanced instrumentation technologies that will improve operational safety and reduce the risk of hydrocarbon spillage. NASA provided unique insights, expansive test facilities, and technical expertise to advance these technologies that would benefit the environment, the public, and commercial industries.

    <gf:abstract>A distinctive feature of many propagating, high-amplitude jet noise waveforms is the presence of acoustic shocks. Metrics indicative of shock presence, specifically the skewness of the time derivative of the waveform, the average steepening factor, and a new wavelet-based metric called the shock energy fraction (SEF), are used to quantify the strength and prevalence of acoustic shocks within waveforms recorded 10-305 m from a tethered military aircraft. The derivative skewness is more sensitive to the presence of the largest and steepest shocks, while the ASF and SEF tend to emphasize aggregate behavior of the entire waveform. These metrics are applied at engine conditions ranging from 50% to 150% engine thrust request, over a wide range of angles and distances, to assess the growth and decay of shock waves. The responses of these metrics point to significant shock formation occurring through nonlinear propagation out to 76 m from the microphone array reference position. Although these strongest shocks decay, the metrics point to continued nonlinear propagation in the far-field, out to 305 m. Many of these features are accurately characterized using a nonlinear propagation scheme based on the Burgers equation, but this scheme fails to account for multipath interference and significant atmospheric effects over the long propagation distances, resulting in an overestimation of nonlinearity metrics. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

        <gf:abstract>Rapidly developing UAS technology necessitates reliable counter UAS systems. This paper proposes a formation controlled dragnet as a possible solution and compares potential intercept algorithms that can be used in this scenario. Proportional navigation and target-predictive path planning, both existing algorithms, are explored and an original approach, Adaptive Radius Optimal Defense (AROD), is introduced. Simulation results are given and the strengths and weaknesses of each approach are discussed. Based on the simulation results, some advantages that AROD offers over other existing algorithms are listed. Possible improvements and future research directions are also suggested. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Autonomous systems, although capable of performing complicated tasks much faster than humans, are brittle due to uncertainties encountered in most real-time applications. People supervising these systems often rely on information relayed by the system to make any decisions, which places a burden on the system to self-assess its proficiency and communicate the relevant information. Proficiency self-assessment benefits from an understanding of how well the models and decision mechanisms used by robot align with the world and a problem holderÕs goals. This paper makes three contributions: (1) Identifying the importance of goal, system, and environment for proficiency assessment; (2) Completing the phrase Òproficient ÜprepositionÝÓ using an understanding of proficiency span; and (3) Proposing the proficiency dependency graph to represent causal relationships that contribute to failures, which highlights how one can reason about their own proficiency given alterations in goal, system, and environment. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Though little research has been done in the field of overdesign as a product development strategy, an over-design approach can help products avoid the issue of premature obsolescence. This paper compares over-design to redesign as approaches to address the emergence of future requirements. Net present value (NPV) analyses of several real world applications are examined from the perspective of manufacturers and customers. This analysis is used to determine the conditions under which an over-design approach provides a greater benefit than a redesign approach. Over-design is found to have a higher net present value than redesign when future requirements occur soon after the initial release, discount rates are low, initial research and development cost or price is high, and when the incremental costs of the future requirements are low.

        <gf:abstract>Front-end planning (FEP) is a critical process for uncovering project unknowns while also developing adequate scope definition and a structured approach for the project execution process. For infrastructure projects, the FEP process assists in identifying and mitigating risks stemming from issues such as right-of-way concerns, utility adjustments, environmental hazards, logistic problems, and permitting requirements. The authors have developed a novel risk management tool, called the project definition rating index (PDRI) for infrastructure projects, which can be used to identify and address these issues systematically and in a structured manner. Input from 64 industry professionals representing over 30 organizations was used in the development of the tool. In addition to a usable definition for infrastructure in the context of the built environment, a finite and specific list of issues related to scope definition of infrastructure projects was developed with this industry input. Data from 26 completed or in-process projects are given. Results show that the PDRI assessment score is indicative of the current level of scope definition for sample projects and corresponds to project performance. Findings support the hypothesis that projects with improved early understanding of scope definition elements showed improved project outcomes; infrastructure projects with low PDRI scores (well defined) outperformed projects with high PDRI scores. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by specifically identifying those FEP elements that are critical to infrastructure projects. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>We conducted a user study that compares three secure email tools that share a common user interface and differ only by key management scheme: passwords, public key directory (PKD), and identity-based encryption (IBE). Our work is the first comparative (i.e., A/B) usability evaluation of three different key management schemes and utilizes a standard quantitative metric for cross-system comparisons. We also share qualitative feedback from participants that provides valuable insights into user attitudes regarding each key management approach and secure email generally. The study serves as a model for future secure email research with A/B studies, standard metrics, and the two-person study methodology. © 2018 by The USENIX Association All Rights Reserved.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>We present a two player gradient play differential game in a producer market with quadratic payoff as a model of behavior in a competitive environment and show that the Nash equilibrium is not efficient. An algorithm is then presented which uses side payments to induce cooperation between firms, and rules for side payment strategies are shown. The stability of the new system at a reasonable equilibrium is proved, and it is shown that all participants are at least as well off as they would be at the non-cooperative equilibrium. Numerical examples show the existence of a reasonable equilibrium and that the basin of attraction of that equilibrium appears to cover all reasonable initial conditions. © 2017 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Participation in internet auctions goes well beyond those who place a bid. Participants arrive in random order, and if the auction's standing price has already exceeded a participant's valuation, she will not bid. Even so, her unreported valuation is a relevant part of demand for the item, and in an alternate random order, her bid would have been registered. I provide a method to estimate the average number of participants from the average number of bidders per auction. This enables estimation of the distribution of participant valuations from either the distribution of closing prices or the distribution of all observed bids. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Combining the resolution of conventional gas chromatography systems with the size factor of microGC systems is important for improving the affordability and portability of high performance gas analysis. Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of high resolution separation of gases in a benchtopscale short column system by controlling thermal gradients through the column. This work reports a microfabricated thermally controllable gas chromatographic column with a small footprint (approximately 6.25 cm2). The design of the 20 cm column utilizes 21 individually controllable thin film heaters and conduction cooling to produce a desired temperature profile. The reported device is capable of heating and cooling rates exceeding 8000 ¡C/min and can reach temperatures of 350 ¡C. The control methods allow for excellent disturbance rejection and precision to within +/- 1 ¡C. Each length of the column between heaters was demonstrated to be individually controllable and displayed quadratic temperature profiles. This paper focuses on the fabrication process and implementation of the thermal control strategy. [2019-0113] © 1992-2012 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>One of the main needs for accurate shrub combustion modeling is the complicated flame growth pattern due to merging of flames from multiple leaves and small branches. A careful study of flame interactions from fuels in three-dimensional arrangements is a necessary step in strengthening operational field models in complex fuel structures. The purpose of this research is to imitate the flame merging of the solid fuels in different geometries in order to describe fire behavior in complex fuel structures, such as trees or shrubs. Ceramic felts soaked in n-heptane were used as a fuel source to conduct flame-merging experiments. Flame characteristics such as flame length and flame width were measured for both single and merged flames. Our data shows that by altering the separation distance between felts in both vertical and horizontal directions, flame area, height and width vary to a large extent. The region of flame merging is mapped in both the horizontal and vertical directions. These data are being used to develop flame-merging correlations as a function of flame spacing, similar to correlations that have been developed for multiple flames in the horizontal plane.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Self-deployable, self-stiffening, and retractable (SDSR) arrays were introduced by the authors as a novel architecture of deployable space structures which leverages array surface topology, as opposed to dedicated structures, to achieve desirable deployed structural performance. The application of the technology to solar electric propulsion is discussed. The effects of array shape are discussed, concluding that circular arrays are more structurally efficient than several smaller rectangular arrays, especially for large scales. A system architecture is proposed that considers circular origami-based flasher SDSR arrays integrated with a spacecraft: stowage restraints during launch, deployment, and repeatable retraction. This paper studies the design and analysis of such arrays for scalability, including the performance metrics of specific power, power density, stiffness, and strength. Key advantages of the architecture are the trends of performance metrics which indicate increased performance with increased array power. The limiting constraint is found to be the stowed height dimension and another candidate folding pattern is discussed that eliminates the height constraint violation. Strengths and weaknesses of the architecture are discussed. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>All products impact the lives of their users, this is called social impact. Some social impacts are commonly recognized by the engineering community, such as impacts to a user's health and safety, while other social impacts can be more difficult to recognize, such as impacts on families and gender roles. When engineers make design decisions, without considering social impacts, they can unknowingly cause negative social impacts. Even harming the user and/or society. Despite its challenges, measuring a program's or policy's social impact is a common practice in the field of social sciences. These measurements are made using social impact indicators, which are simply the things observed to verify that true progress is being made. While there are clear benefits to predicting the social impact of an engineered product, it is unclear how engineers should select indicators and build predictive social impact models that are functions of engineering parameters and decisions. This paper introduces a method for selecting social impact indicators and creating predictive social impact models that can help engineers predict and improve the social impact of their products. As a first step in the method, an engineer identifies the product's users, objectives, and requirements. Then, the social impact categories that are related to the product are determined. From each of these categories, the engineer selects several social impact indicators. Finally, models are created for each indicator to predict how a product's parameters will change these indicators. The impact categories and indicators can be translated into product requirements and performance measures that can be used in product development processes. This method is used to predict the social impact of the proposed, expanded U.S. Mexico border wall. © 2019 Copernicus GmbH. All rights reserved.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This research demonstrated the ability to produce high quality fiberglass-epoxy rebar using a continuous three-dimensional braiding process. The tensile pull-out strength of the composite rebar embedded in concrete was measured and compared to steel rebar. Fiberglass/epoxy is less likely to corrode than steel rebar, ensuring more sustainable concrete structures in infrastructure applications. The 0.5" diameter composite rebar was produced by pulling hundreds of strands of unidirectional fiberglass/epoxy towpreg to form the core of a cylindrical rod. The rods were consolidated by overwrapping strands of aramid fiber under tension in a spiral fashion, and cured using the manufacturer's (TCR Composites) recommended 250¡F cure cycle. Configurations manufactured and tested included tow variations of aramid overwrap (dry and prepreg) with and without sand coating embedded in concrete cubes (8"x8"x8"). The results are compared to baseline values obtained by testing traditional steel rebar and commercially-Available fiberglass composite rebar. The tensile pull-out (bond) strength was quantified using a test fixture in accordance with ACI 440.3R-12. Measurements were collected at both the free and loaded ends of the rebar, with freeend results yielding a more accurate indication of rebar bond stress. The bond strength of the in-house manufactured fiberglass/epoxy rebar was comparable to steel rebar and commercial fiberglass composite rebar. The sand coating increased the surface roughness, improving the bond strength of the composite rebar by margins of 43-58% percent. Fiberglass/epoxy composite rebar consolidated with prepreg aramid tow and subsequently coated with sand resulted in a bond strength slightly higher, but comparable to steel. This study demonstrates the ability to consistently produce high quality fiberglass/epoxy composite rebar using an innovative, low cost, high production rate, three-dimensional braiding process. © 2018 33rd Technical Conference of the American Society for Composites 2018.

    <gf:abstract>Masonry walls and columns are common structural members that typically resist compressive loads, with a number of such members being required to resist combined axial load and out-of-plane bending due to direct out-of-plane loads or an eccentricity of the axial compressive load. Flexural compression strength is usually greater than axial compression strength, and a reasonable experimental data set supports this assertion. However, little information exists for high-strength concrete block masonry subjected to combined axial and flexural loadings. This paper presents axial and flexural compression strengths and deformation properties of high-strength concrete block masonry. Seventy-two masonry prisms were constructed and tested to evaluate the capacity and behavior of high-strength structural masonry subject to compressive concentric and eccentric loading; both grouted and hollow prisms were used. Block strengths of 44, 56, and 67 MPa are considered. The results show an increase of flexural compression strength of 15-29% for the hollow prisms and of 70-79% for the grouted prisms compared with their axial compression strength. Measured ultimate strain varies from 0.14 to 0.19% for the axial compression and from 0.20 to 0.25% for the flexural compression. Hollow prism strength varies from 52 to 62% of the block strength, whereas grouted prism strength varies from 43 to 59% of the block strength. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Precise temperature control of FSW benefits from control and manipulated signals that are responsive and smooth. Accurate measurement of tool temperature and spindle speed feedback are important to temperature control, but often noise in these signals prevents optimal control. Two different methods are developed in this paper to improve signal quality. A series of Bezier curves are used to compensate signals which exhibit a periodic but arbitrarily-shaped offset. Least-squares fitting is used to obtain quality derivatives from discrete or noisy signals. The Bezier method is used to decrease the inaccurate temperature fluctuation measurements reported by telemetry collar error and adds no time delay or phase shift. The least-squares approach is used to estimate spindle speed and temperature derivatives and adds only minimal time delay while substantially reducing noise. © 2019, The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>To maintain high, broad-band reflectance, thin transparent fluoride layers, such as MgF2, are used to protect the of aluminum mirrors against oxidation since aluminum oxide absorbs short wavelength light. In this study, we present, for the first time, combined X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ellipsometric (SE) studies of aluminum oxidation as a function of MgF2 over a range of layer thickness (0-6 nm). We also show for the first time, dynamic SE data which, with appropriate modeling, tracks the extent of oxide growth every few seconds over a period of several hours after the evaporated Al + MgF2 bilayer is removed from the deposition chamber, exposing it to the air. For each SE data set, because the optical constants of ultrathin metals films depend strongly on deposition conditions and their thickness, the optical constants for Al, as well as the Al and Al2O3 thicknesses, were fit. SE trends were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. There is a chemical shift in the Al 2s electron emission peak toward higher binding energy as the metal oxidizes to Al+3. The extent of oxide growth can be modeled from the relative area of each peak once they are corrected for the attenuation through MgF2 layer. This generates an empirical formula: oxide thickness= k_log(t) +b, for the time-dependent aluminum-oxide thickness on aluminum surfaces protected by MgF2 as a function of MgF2 layer thickness. Here, k is a factor which depends only on MgF2 thickness, and decreases with increasing MgF2 thickness. The techniques developed can illuminate other protected mirror systems. © 2019 SPIE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>When developing compact and lightweight antenna systems for unmanned aerial systems, achieving high isolation between transmit and receive signal paths is challenging. To address this issue, we demonstrate a prototype isolation design on a printed circuit board for a frequency division duplexed X band antenna system. Key components include a microstrip defected ground plane notch filter and a copper grating barrier that provides 20 dB higher isolation than free space separation between the transmit and receive antennas. The hardware provides at least 105 dB of transmit isolation into the receiver low noise amplifier in the transmit band. The proposed design is lighter and more compact than traditional machined metal waveguide isolation techniques used for ground-based systems yet achieves similar isolation performance. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Following previous theoretical development based on the assumption of a rank correlated/comonotonic spectrum, the Locally Correlated SLW (LC-SLW) method is outlined. The relationship between the LC-SLW method and the RC-SLW method is established, and their performance in prediction of radiative transfer is compared. Despite the fact that the RC-SLW model demonstrates better overall accuracy, the LC-SLW model generally proves more accurate in regions of higher gas temperature. © Begell House Inc. 2020.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Reconstruction of 3D objects from UAV EO imagery yields useful information, but can be time consuming and computationally expensive. View planning reduces processing time by selecting the optimal image set needed to reconstruct a scene. This paper demonstrates how view planning is used in a targeted manner to select a subset of images from a large existing image set to model specific vehicles or structures. Potential applications of the method include enabling 3D target classification algorithms and rapid geo-location. The method could also facilitate on-board reconstruction. The view planning algorithm is tested on five different targets, and is shown to reduce processing time for target models by up to a factor of 50 with little decrease in accuracy. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

        <gf:abstract>The performance of seven sediment transport equations for bedload transport is compared using almost 2,600 of more than 8,000 measurements from a recent compilation. Named equations tested include the Meyer-Peter Muller, Barry, Pagosa good condition, Wilcock, Parker (both calibrated and uncalibrated), Recking, and that of Elhakeem and Imran. The purpose of the tests was to evaluate the performance of several empirical and semiempirical formulae using a single calibration point relative to three uncalibrated equations. The seven equations were included because they either have a calibration procedure already developed, are used frequently in practice, are historically foundational in the field, or have recently been proposed. Results are expressed in the root mean square error of the logarithms (RMSEL) and the relative mean error (RME) and show that the Pagosa good and Barry equations best predict bedload sediment transport (RMSEL of 0.02 and 0.02, respectively). The Pagosa good equation requires a data point for bankfull discharge and the corresponding bedload transport. The uncalibrated Recking (2013) equation resulted in lower errors than two of the calibrated formulae (Wilcock 2001 and Parker 1990) and was not far behind the calibrated Elhakeem and Imran (2016) formula. The Meyer-Peter Muller and uncalibrated Parker (1990) equations performed the worst (RMSEL of up to 0.85 and 0.86, respectively). The results herein demonstrate: (1) empirical formulae were more successful at predicting bedload transport than semiempirical alternatives, (2) a single calibration point significantly improves the predictive accuracy of any formula, and (3) calibration cannot compensate for all the shortcomings of a model. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>A majority of coding constructions for physical-layer security are based on linear block codes and their cosets. One issue with these codes is that they require knowledge of channel state information (CSI) for both the friendly party and the eavesdropper in the wiretap channel prior to constructing the code. In this paper, we present a framework for rateless physical-layer security codes over the wiretap channel by introducing both fixed and adaptive variants of rateless security coding schemes. These techniques can be used to reduce the requirements on CSI prior to code construction, because the codes will either adapt to the operating parameters of the legitimate user's channel on the fly and/or target a maximum allowable probability of intercept (POI) at the eavesdropper. All channels in play are packet erasure channels (PECs), as these channels are quite pervasive in most real-world network applications. We further present the details of an actual implementation of rateless physical-layer security coding over a Wi-Fi network. © 2018 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This paper proposes a new ensemble feature selector, called the majority voting feature selector (MVFS), for developing new maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) prediction models using a support vector machine (SVM). The approach is based on rank aggregation, which meaningfully utilizes the correlation among the relevance ranks of predictor variables given by three state-of-the-art feature selectors: Relief-F, minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR), and maximum likelihood feature selection (MLFS). By applying the SVM combined with MVFS on a self-created dataset containing maximal and submaximal exercise data from 185 college students, several new hybrid VO2max prediction models have been created. To compare the performance of the proposed ensemble approach on prediction of VO2max, SVM-based models with individual combinations of Relief-F, mRMR, and MLFS as well as with other alternative ensemble feature selectors from the literature have also been developed. The results reveal that MVFS outperforms other individual and ensemble feature selectors and yields up to 8.76% increment and 11.15% decrement rates in multiple correlation coefficients (Rs) and root mean square errors (RMSEs), respectively. Furthermore, in addition to reconfirming the relevance of sex, age, and maximal heart rate in predicting VO2max, which were previously reported in the literature, it is revealed that submaximal heart rates and exercise times at 1.5-mile distance are two further discriminative predictors of VO2max. The results have also been compared to those obtained by a general regression neural network and single decision tree combined with MVFS, and it is shown that the SVM exhibits much better performance than other methods for prediction of VO2max. © TB_TAK</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>The Mw 7.8 Muisne-Pedernales, Ecuador, earthquake on April 16, 2016, produced significant damage through the northwest coast of Ecuador. Important state infrastructure was seriously affected, including one of the major seaports in the country, the Port of Manta, located in the city that bears its name. This paper focuses on the geotechnical exploration, site characterization, and analyses performed for the marginal wharf's embankment of the port, where clear evidence of liquefaction was observed. Laboratory results showed that the embankment was composed of gravelly sand and sandy gravels, which limited the applicability of common exploration techniques, such as SPT and CPTu tests. Subsequently, liquefaction triggering evaluations were performed based on Vs and the Chinese dynamic penetration test (DPT), which can account for the large gravel content in the soils. The results of this evaluation are presented and compared with field observations showing that these methods correctly identified the potential for liquefaction in the embankment. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Gulf War Illness is a disease that affects about a third of the veterans that served in the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War. The symptoms are varied, the cause is unknown, and there is no known treatment. In this paper we compare the dynamic characteristics of cytokines feedback response to exercise in n=12 veterans diagnosed with Gulf War Illness (GWI) and n=12 healthy veterans deployed to the same theatre of operations. A third-order transfer function is used to model the process dynamics of 18 cytokines projected onto principal components with a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller enforcing the homeostatic regulation of these co-expression patterns. Transfer functions were fit to each subject for each principal component and the dynamic response parameters compared between the veteran control and GWI subject groups. Results of this analysis indicate that while much of the regulatory response dynamics are shared by both groups, there is a significant difference in the damping of the Th1:Th2 cytokine response to exercise in Gulf War Illness. © 2019 Association of Computing Machinery.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Robots are widely used to support mission-critical, high-risk and complex operations. Human supervision and remote robot control are often required to operate robots in unpredictable and changing scenarios. Often, robots are controlled remotely by technicians via joystick interfaces which require training and experience to operate. To improve robot usage and practicality, we propose using augmented reality (AR) to create a more intuitive, less training-intensive means of controlling robots than traditional joystick control. AR is a creative platform for developing robot control systems, because AR combines the real world (the environment around the user, the physical robot, etc.) with the digital world (holograms, digital displays, etc.); it can even interpret physical gestures, such as pinching two fingers. In this research, a Microsoft Hololens headset is used to create an AR environment to control a Yaskawa Motoman SIA5D robot. The control process begins with the user placing an interactable holographic robot in 3D space. The user can then select between two control methods: manual control and automatic control. In manual control, the user can move the end effector of the holographic robot and the physical robot will respond immediately. In automatic control, the user can move the end effector of the holographic robot to a desired location, view a holographic preview of the motion, and select execute if the motion plan is satisfactory. In this preview mode, the user is able to preview both the motion of the robot and the torques experienced by the joints of the manipulator. This gives the user additional feedback on the planned motion. In this project we succeeded in creating an AR control system that makes controlling a robotic manipulator intuitive and effective. © 2020, Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Significant turbine-wake interactions greatly reduce power output in a wind farm. If different turbine hub heights and rotor diameters are included in the same wind farm, the wake interference in the farm will be reduced, resulting in a lower cost of energy (COE) than a farm with identical turbines. In this paper, we present a method to model wind farm COE in farms with hub heights and rotor diameters that vary across the wind farm. We also demonstrate how to optimize these wind farms to minimize COE. The results show that COE can be greatly reduced in wind farms with non-homogeneous turbines, especially when the turbines are spaced close together. For a unidirectional wind rose, including different turbine design in the wind farm has a similar decrease in COE to spreading the wind turbines farther apart. When the rotor diameter and hub height of the wind turbines in a farm are optimized uniformly, a COE decrease of 4% to 13% (depending on the grid spacing and wind shear exponent) is achieved compared to the baseline. When the rotor diameter and turbine heights are optimized non-uniformly, with two different diameters and heights throughout the farm, there is a COE decrease of 22% to 41% compared to the baseline. For a more spread wind rose with a dominant probability from the west, there is a COE decrease between 3% and 10% for uniformly optimized rotor diameter and height compared to the baseline. With two optimized rotor diameters and heights through the farm, a COE decrease of 3% to 19% is achieved. For a similar wind rose shifted such that the dominant wind direction is from the northwest, a COE decrease between 3% and 10% results from uniformly optimized wind turbines compared to the baseline. A COE decrease of 3% to 17% compared to the baseline occurs with two different turbines are optimized throughout the wind farm. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

    <gf:abstract>Measurements of full-scale high-performance military aircraft reveal phenomena that are not widely seen at laboratory scales. However, recent modifications to large eddy-simulation (LES) methods allow for simulations of jets operating at a high-temperature ratio in a similar regime as military aircraft operating at afterburner. This work applies coherence analyses that have been previously used to study the jet noise field produced by military aircraft to the LES of a highly heated laboratory-scale jet. The coherence of the complex pressures along a near-field line approximately parallel to the shear layer as well as along the nozzle lip line shows evidence of distinct noise production mechanisms that transfer information differently from the flow to the field. A phenomenological comparison between the LES and measurements of an afterburning F-35 aircraft is then made. Although the LES is not run at the exact same conditions as the aircraft and does not reproduce all of the phenomena present in the aircraftÕs jet noise field, differences between noise production mechanisms observed in the LES may describe some of the spatiospectral lobe phenomena observed in the measurements of the F-35. © 2020 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

    <gf:abstract>Large-eddy simulations (LES) have been shown to reproduce the flow and acoustic fields of laboratory-scale jets with increasing accuracy. However, measurements of full-scale, high-performance military aircraft reveal phenomena that are not widely seen at laboratory scales. Recent modifications to LES methods allow for simulations of jets operating at a high temperature ratio, in a similar regime as military aircraft operating at afterburner. This work applies coherence analyses that have been previously used to study the jet noise field produced by military aircraft to the LES of a highly-heated, laboratory-scale jet. The coherence of the complex pressures along a near-field line approximately parallel to the shear layer shows evidence of four distinct field regions. The coherence between this line and complex pressures along the simulated jet lipline provide source regions in the jet plume corresponding to each field region. Differences in how information is transferred from the flow to the field suggests that the source regions represent different noise production mechanisms. The field regions compare favorably to some spatiospectral lobe features observed in measurements of an F-35B aircraft operating at afterburner, though do not reproduce all of the phenomena present in the aircraftÕs jet noise field. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

        <gf:abstract>Structural health monitoring has been an expanding discipline due to its potential to decrease maintenance and downtime costs, detect failure early, extend life spans, and fulfill the increased need of safety and security. Acoustic source identification techniquesÕ have been used for remote structural health monitoring, but the applicability of each technique has been limited by factors ranging from achievable spatial resolution to hardware costs. This paper aims to mitigate current acoustic techniquesÕ limitations by exploring the possibility of fusing acoustic and video data. This paper focuses on combining microphone acoustic measurements with vibrational information recovered from video-based measurements. Among acoustic methods, acoustic arrays have been used for remotely detecting, localizing and characterizing acoustic sources. Acoustic-array based techniques are limited in their ability to discriminate multiple closely-spaced acoustic sources from far-field acoustic pressure signals. On the contrary, video-based techniques have shown the ability to recover full-field, high resolution mode shapes, and the associated frequencies and damping ratios with virtually no dependence with the distance from the target. The challenge with video methods, applied to acoustic source identification, is that acoustic sources may occur in the kilohertz range requiring a higher frame per second sampling rate than most low cost cameras. Acoustic measurements provide additional information content that is used to recover the correct frequency content of an acoustically radiating structure from temporally-aliased (sub-Nyquist) video measurements. Experiments are conducted to show how combining acoustic and video data relaxes the hardware requirements for acoustic source detection and localization applications. © 2020, The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>In this paper, an accelerometer and gyroscope are used to sense gesture commands, which are then classified using a logistic regression model. Seven gestures were chosen and mapped to specific behaviors that a fixed wing unmanned air vehicle could accomplish. These behaviors specified various searching, following, and tracking patterns that could be used in a dynamic environment. The system was trained to recognize the seven gestures and then tested in a hardware-in-the-loop simulation. The system was able to identify all gestures with an overall accuracy of 90% and with five of the seven gestures being accurately identified at least 94% of the time. Each of the behaviors associated with the gestures was tested in simulation and the ability to dynamically switch between behaviors was proven. The results show that the system can be used as a natural interface to assist an operator in directing an unmanned air vehicle's behaviors. © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>An important consideration for fan and compressor design is quantifying distortion transfer and generation blade row by blade row. Detailed information about the magnitude of distortion and the shape of the distortion profile and how it changes through blade rows increases the understanding of flow physics and helps predict aerodynamic performance. Using full annulus URANS simulations, this paper analyzes what happens to distortion as it passes through the rotor and stator blade rows at 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90% span. Fourier distortion descriptors are used in this study to quantitatively describe distortion transfer and generation. With these descriptors, evidence of pressure-induced swirl is shown at the fan inlet. It is also shown that although there is very little distortion at the 10% span of the inlet, after passing through the rotor blade row the 10% span has the greatest amount of total pressure and total temperature distortion. This radial migration of distortion is attributed to the high hade angle of the hub. The total pressure and total temperature profiles have significant circumferential phase shifts after passing through the rotor and slight phase shifts after passing through the stator. In general, the calculated phase shifts are greatest at the 10% and 90% spans, the nearest locations to the hub and the tip clearance gap, respectively. Copyright © 2018 ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>This paper summarizes the analysis of bit error rate data captured during flight tests designed to compare data-aided equalizers with SOQPSK-TG to unequalized and currently available blind, adaptive equalizers with SOQPSK-TG. The number of bit errors, on a second-by-second basis, are analyzed. The results are different for each test point. Given the uncertain behavior of the preamble detector for the data-aided equalizer and the differing channel conditions between the data-aided equalizer channel and the conventional serial streaming telemetry channel, we are unable to draw any firm comparative conclusions.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>In this paper, we apply well-known techniques for parametric curves to the definition and deformation of airfoil sections. While it has already been shown that many versions of KulfanÕs Class Shape Transformation (CST) are exactly equivalent to Bzier curves, we show here that all NACA 4-digit thickness distributions and the PARSEC parametrization of Sobiezcky are also higher-order Bzier curves. As with CST, Bziers and B-Splines provide direct control over aerodynamically meaningful features such as nose radius and boat-tail angle, but also provide more a intuitive parametrization of the rest of the airfoil surface. We show the efficacy of B-Spline-based parametrizations for approximating airfoil coordinates and for clean-sheet airfoil design. Finally, we show that this parametrization is ideally suited for progressive design. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Sustainability is broadly defined to mean systems that are able to meet the needs of current and future generations by being physically resilient, cost-effective, environmentally viable, and socially equitable. While the term is applied to various types of infrastructure, the real application of sustainability practices needs to be applied to underground water infrastructure. In order to determine the best sustainable outcomes a common standard of weighing alternatives and making decisions should be followed. The International Standards Organization (ISO) is an independent, non-governmental organization which facilitates world trade by providing common standards between nations. The ISO has standards which can benefit sustainable infrastructure decision making specifically in 3 main areas: life cycle assessment, life cycle costing, and asset management. This paper defines a sustainable framework for underground pipe infrastructure in the context of ISO standards and industry best practices. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Distributed electric propulsion is a key enabling technology for on-demand electric aircraft concepts. NASAÕs X-57 Maxwell X-plane is a demonstrator for this technology, and it features a row of high-lift propellers distributed along the leading edge of its wing to enable better aerodynamic efficiency at cruise and improved ride quality in addition to less noise and emissions. This study applies adjointbased multidisciplinary design optimization to this highly coupled design problem. The propulsion, aerodynamics, and structures are modeled using blade element momentum theory, the vortex lattice method, and finite element analysis, respectively, and the full mission profile is discretized and analyzed. The design variables in the optimization problem include the altitude profile, the velocity profile, battery weight, propeller diameter, blade profile parameters, wing thickness distribution, and angle of attack. Optimizations take on the order of 10 hours, and a 12% increase in range is observed. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Consideration of a product's manufacturability is a vital aspect of product design. When considering manufacturability of panels for origami-adapted products, there are tradeoffs between panel design approaches as well as thicknessaccommodation techniques. The use of bent sheet metal for panels shows promise as a panel design approach that mitigates several of these trade-offs. This paper describes a process that can be employed to use sheet metal in designs of origami-adapted mechanisms that utilize specific thickness-accommodation techniques. The process is demonstrated for a square-twist mechanism designed using the hinge shift technique for accommodating thickness in origami patterns. A Miura-ori mechanism is also shown in sheet metal. The characteristics of these bent panel approaches are discussed and compared to other approaches for designing panels for manufacturing. The use of bent sheet metal panels allows for mitigation of several trade-offs and shows the applicability of origami-adapted design to sheet metal. Copyright © 2017 ASME.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>This paper investigates the performance of sparse minimum mean squared error (MMSE) equalizer for generalized time-reversed space-time block codes (GTR-STBC) in aeronautical telemetry. GTR-STBC equipped with MMSE equalizer performs the best trade-offbetween the signal-tonoise ratio and inter-symbol interference by allocating unequal power over aeronautical telemetry channels. However, aeronautical telemetry channels are in general consists of larger delay spreads which make the MMSE equalization of aeronautical channels with GTR-STBC computationally complex. Interestingly enough, in spite of larger delays aeronautical channels are made of few sparsely distributed multipaths and therefore their MMSE equalizers are highly compressible. In this paper, compressed sensing based greedy algorithm is used for the design of sparse MMSE equalizer and a convex curve-fitting algorithm is used to find the sub-optimum power allocation parameter at the same sparsity level for GTR-STBC. Our simulation results show that 75-90% of the non-zero equalizer taps can be reduced with a slight relaxation of the mean-squared error (or equivalently slight degradation of bit-error rate performance). It is also observed that the optimum transmitter power profile for the sparse MMSE equalizer is different than that of the non-sparse equalizer.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>The selection of an appropriate seismic steel system (braced frame, moment frame, shear wall, etc.) is often influenced by architectural considerations. Moment frame configurations offer the most architectural flexibility, but are somewhat limited by a lack of guidance in the AISC seismic provisions regarding the use of non-orthogonal (skewed) beam-column connections. A recent study investigating laterally skewed moment frame connections indicates adequate seismic performance; however, it was observed that skewed connections increase the potential for column twist and column flange yielding. It is unclear how larger column axial loads present in medium-to-high-rise structures will affect the performance of skewed special moment frame connections. This study investigates the effects of column axial loads on skewed special moment frame connections containing reduced beam sections (RBSs). Detailed finite element analyses are used for all investigations, and several beam-column connection configurations are considered, representing: 3 beam-column geometries (shallow, medium and deep columns); 4 levels of skew at the beam-to-column connection; and 4 levels of applied column axial load. Results indicate that for axial loads less than 50% of the column axial capacity, there is little effect on connection rotation capacity. Beam-skew angle is the main contributor to resulting column twist. With the exception of the deep column geometries that experienced local flange buckling at 50% _Pn axial load, increased column axial loads have little effect on resulting column flange yielding in skewed RBS moment connections. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>For goal-based robot navigation in a dynamic environment, human intent includes expectations about what performance objectives are satisfied by a planned path in terms of objectives to be met. If the planned path drifts from the human's intent as a result of environment changes, the path needs to be replanned. This paper presents a replanning framework with three elements: (a) the integration of fast online path-planning algorithms that generate trajectories conforming to the given intent; (b) a mathematical model that says when replanning must happen; and (c) an evaluation of events that trigger replanning. An interactive graphical user interface enables a human to accept or reject replanned paths when a trigger happens. A study of 50 MTurk participants is used to assess what replanning triggers best enable a human-robot collaboration to persistently satisfy intent? © 2019 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Small unmanned aerial vehicles play increasingly important roles in many industries and organizations in the United States and around the globe. As usage becomes more widespread, airspace will become increasingly crowded. These high-density unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) situations will pose many unique challenges, including in conflict resolution. Using agent-based models, conflict resolution and the well-clear and action-distance concepts for small multirotor UAVs in dense environments were explored. Specifically, the safety and efficiency of several collision-avoidance mechanisms under different possible densities, accelerations, and action distances were investigated. The results suggest that selecting appropriate action distances and collision-avoidance mechanisms will be vital to maintaining safety and efficiency. Interestingly, excessive action distances quickly degrade performance: using a simple method under high-density conditions (1 UAV_km2), well-clear distances above approximately 750 m have extremely low efficiency (_1% as many deliveries accomplished in 5000 simulation hours compared to lower distances). More advanced algorithms also suffer from low efficiency at higher (_1 km) response distances. Different definitions for near-midair collisions and their effects on system safety and well-clear distance are discussed. © 2018 by John Salmon.

        <gf:abstract>Turbine wakes reduce power production in a wind farm. Current wind farms are generally built with turbines that are all the same height, but if wind farms included turbines with different tower heights, the cost of energy may be reduced. We used gradient-based optimization to demonstrate a method to optimize wind farms with varied hub heights. Our study includes a modified version of the FLORIS wake model that accommodates three-dimensional wakes integrated with a tower structural model. Our purpose was to design a process to minimize the cost of energy of a wind farm through layout optimization and varying turbine hub heights. Results indicate that when a farm is optimized for layout and height with two separate height groups, COE can be lowered by as much as 5-9%, compared to a similar layout and height optimization where all the towers are the same. The COE has the best improvement in farms with high turbine density and low wind shear exponent. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

        <gf:abstract>As mechanisms with origami-like movement increase in popularity, there is a need for conducting electrical power across folds. This need could potentially be filled by the use of surrogate folds. Surrogate folds are a localized reduction in stiffness in a given direction allowing the material to function like a fold. Current methods for conducting across folds are reviewed along with current opportunities. A framework for designing conductive surrogate folds that can be adapted to fit specific applications is presented. Equations for calculating the resistance in single surrogate folds as well as arrays are given. Prototypes of several conductive joints are presented and discussed. The framework is then followed in the designing and manufacturing of a conductive origami-inspired mechanism. Copyright © 2017 ASME.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Adherence to security warnings continues to be an important problem in information security. Although users may fail to heed a security warning for a variety of reasons, a major contributor is habituation, which is decreased response to repeated stimulation. However, the scope of this problem may actually be much broader than previously thought because of the neurobiological phenomenon of generalization. Whereas habituation describes a diminished response with repetitions of the same stimulus, generalization occurs when habituation to one stimulus carries over to other novel stimuli that are similar in appearance. Generalization has important implications for the domains of usable security and human-computer interaction. Because a basic principle of user interface design is visual consistency, generalization suggests that through exposure to frequent non-security-related notifications (e.g., dialogs, alerts, confirmations, etc.) that share a similar look and feel, users may become deeply habituated to critical security warnings that they have never seen before. Further, with the increasing number of notifications in our lives across a range of mobile, Internet of Things, and computing devices, the accumulated effect of generalization may be substantial. However, this problem has not been empirically examined before. This paper contributes by measuring the impacts of generalization in terms of (1) diminished attention via mouse cursor tracking and (2) users' ability to behaviorally adhere to security warnings. Through an online experiment, we find that: ¥ Habituation to a frequent non-security-related notification does carry over to a one-time security warning. ¥ Generalization of habituation is manifest both in (1) decreased attention to warnings and (2) lower warning adherence behavior. ¥ The carry-over effect, most importantly, is due to generalization, and not fatigue. ¥ The degree that generalization occurs depends on the similarity in look and feel between a notification and warning. These findings open new avenues of research and provide guidance to software developers for creating warnings that are more resistant to the effects of generalization of habituation, thereby improving users' security warning adherence. © is held by the author/owner.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Precision Medicine focuses on collecting and using individual-level data to improve healthcare outcomes. To date, research efforts have been motivated by molecular-scale measurements, such as incorporating genomic data into clinical use. In many cases however, environmental, social, and economic factors are much more predictive of health outcomes, yet are not systematically used in clinical practice due to the difficulties in measurement and quantification. Advances in both the availability of electronic health information, environmental exposure data, and the more systematic use of geo-coding now provide ways to systematically assess community-level indicators of health, and link these factors to electronic health records for evaluating their influence on disease outcomes. In this workshop, we discuss new electronic sources of community-level data, and provide insight into their utility and validity when compared with gold-standard data collection approaches. © 2017 The Authors.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Although inflatable soft robots are not yet a common robot platform, air leaking from the internal structure is a common and undesirable mode of failure for these platforms. In this paper we demonstrate a method to detect leaks in the structural chamber of an inflatable, pneumatically actuated robot. We then show that our method can adaptively lower commanded joint stiffness which slows the mass flow rate of the leak. This extends the operational life of the robot by decreasing long term error during operation by as much as 50% of the steady state error at the end effector when compared to the same leak if our adaptation method is not used. In future applications where we expect soft, inflatable robots to be useful, our methods can enable failure mitigation in resource-limited situations such as space exploration or disaster response. © 2017 IEEE.</gf:abstract>

        <gf:abstract>Evaluation of deteriorating highway bridges requires new, rapid inspection methods to effectively guide repair in an era of limited fiscal resources. Of all the components of a bridge, the bridge deck typically deteriorates most quickly and must therefore be regularly inspected for non-visible internal cracking, called delamination, for which early detection and repair can enhance safety and performance as well as reduce long-term maintenance costs. This research demonstrates the development and deployment of a multi-channel acoustic impact-echo sounding apparatus equipped with specially-configured tire chains for acoustic excitation of the concrete, microphones, an array of sensors for establishing spatial position estimates, and a data processing architecture for accurately detecting and mapping delaminations in concrete bridge decks at high speeds. The new apparatus achieved very accurate results at speeds between 25 and 45Êkm/h across a bridge deck. These results demonstrate an orders-of-magnitude increase in data collection speed over all other acoustic impact-echo sounding techniques described in the literature. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</gf:abstract>

    <gf:abstract>Emergency landing is a critical safety feature for the expected increase of autonomous vehicles in the airspace. This paper presents Safe2Ditch, an autonomous crash management system for landing small unmanned aerial vehicles in populated environments. Using a prepopulated database, the highest-rated landing site is selected. As the vehicle progresses toward the selected landing site, a camera is used to image the area around the landing site. Using a recently developed visual multiple target tracker, moving ground obstacles are tracked and geolocated using a flat Earth model. These inertial target estimates are used to revise the landing site and allow the vehicle to land quickly in the presence of non-cooperative obstacles. The complete system is demonstrated through 2000 Monte Carlo simulations and 16 hardware flight tests. Copyright © 2019 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.
